            "['Jack and Dane were great friends. Every evening they played together. They studied in the same class in the same school. They were good students. \\n One evening, Jack and Dane were playing with a ball. After a while, Jack said, “I am so bored. Shall we go for fishing in the river?”\\n “That is a great idea,” replied Dane. \\n Jack called out to his mother,” Mama, we are going fishing in the river, okay?”\\n “Okay,” Jack’s mother said, “but be careful not to get into the water. Your father said there are crocodiles in the river.”\\n Both the children said that they would not get into the river. They gathered their fishing lines with the hooks, and a can full of bait. They strolled to the river, and soon began fishing. \\n However, even after a long time, they did not get any fish. They began to feel bored again. “This river looks not so deep. Why does mother say not to swim here?” asked Jack.\\n “Remember, your mother said there are crocodiles here,” said Dane.\\n “Well, I don’t find any,” said Jack.\\n Dane was quiet for a while. Finally he asked, “Do you think we can swim?”\\n Jack jumped up and shouted excitedly, “Yes, let us swim. Come on, dive.”\\n The two friends dove in, and splashed around happily. They found some logs of wood floating on the river, and tried floating with them. It was then that something unexpected happened. \\n Dane was playing with a log of wood, and suddenly, the log was caught in a strong current, and he was hit in the head. He became unconscious immediately. \\n Jack saw what happened, and he swam fast to his friend’s rescue. However, Dane was too heavy for Jack to drag to the shore, so he shouted for help.\\n “Help! My friend is drowning.”\\n At the same time, he saw a movement a little far away. He realized he was looking at a crocodile and was terrified. \\n He began to panic and to cry. The crocodile was going to get them any moment. \\n Suddenly a loud splash was heard. Jack looked up to see his father and mother in the river, by his side. In a flash, they got both the friends to the shore.\\n They sprinkled some water on Dane’s face and brought him back to consciousness, but he was very weak. Jack was too shocked to speak. He felt very guilty. Finally, he stammered, “I am sorry, father. I will listen to you and mother in the future. Promise.”\\n The friends learnt a lesson.\\n Moral: Children who disobey their parents will get into trouble.\\n', '\\n\\n Once upon a time, there were two horses, which lived together on a shelf. However, these were not real horses, that lived and breathed, but they were real in another sort of way. The shelf they lived in was in a big shop. There, they were waiting for someone to come and purchase them.\\n One of the horses was a fine wooden horse, carved out of a single block of wood. He had a muscular body with athletic legs, and a magnificent carved mane. His body was rubbed smooth with sandpaper and he was deep brownish in color. The other horse was a Bankura Horse. He had a thickset body, four short perfectly shaped legs, and a very long, long neck. He was also brown, but he was made of clay, instead of wood. \\n One day the wooden horse, bored with sitting on the stand, stuck up a conversation with the Bankura horse. He told the Bankura that he was bored of sitting on that shelf all day, gathering dust and doing nothing. \\n The Bankura horse replied meekly that he was quite happy sitting around and that he liked it there. The wooden horse once again snorted and complained that he did not like that place and that he hated it there. He was going to do something about it and was planning to go galloping. The Bankura was lost as to what galloping was, and asked the wooden horse as to what it meant. \\n The wooden sighed at his companion’s ignorance, albeit innocence, all the while shaking his mane. He was lost as to how he came to be a horse, not knowing what galloping was. He then added that galloping came natural to horses and it was all horses did, i.e., to run at nice, fast pace. \\n The Bankura was a bit apprehensive, when he heard about running, as he said it was something that he definitely could not do. “Aw, don’t be such a spoil sport. I am sure you would love it. That is what all horses do,” said the wooden horse. \\n The terracotta horse insisted that he was afraid, as it was something that he could not do. He insisted that he was built to stand still and not to move around. He went on to say that, he could fall, if he tried to gallop and would break into a hundred pieces. \\n The wooden pooh-poohed all this and called it as nonsense. He insisted that the Bankura was such a fine horse and that horses were meant to gallop. He commended on the Bankura’s strong body and long legs! He said that they were perfect for galloping and asked him to get ready to gallop. \\n The Bankura horse was still not satisfied. \\n The wooden horse continued to try and persuade the Bankura to at least to try and walk. Then the wooden horse slowly clop-clopped, up and down on the shelf. The Bankura had to admit, it was not so difficult, and saying so, he soon got down to it. Soon he too was moving, but not as fluid as the wooden horse. He found it difficult to balance and found it stiff and rather uncomfortable. \\n “Bravo!” commended the wooden horse enthusiastically and was extremely pleased at the Bankura’s effort, and said that he will soon be galloping around in no time. \\n But the Bankura insisted that he was not sure as to whether to continue, as he did not like it very much. \\n The wooden horse was angry and was having none of this nonsense. He snapped decisively and ordered the Bankura to continue. The Bankura horse had no choice but to continue walk up and down. But, his steps continued to be jerky and uneven. \\n After a while, the wooden horse felt that the Bankura had enough of practice, and that it was time to gallop. He then advised the Bankura to watch him gallop. \\n He pranced up and down on the shelf. First, he quickened his steps to a canter and then he burst into a great speed as he galloped up and down on the shelf. Finally, he stopped and looked at the Bankura horse. \\n The Bankura watched with awe at the wooden horse galloping. Although that was something he did want to try, he knew it was just not meant for him. The wooden horse then ordered the Bankura to try it. However, the Bankura refused as he felt that his legs were not meant for galloping and that he could likely fall down. \\n Again, he pooh-poohed and ordered the Bankura to get on with it. However, the Bankura refused to move and said that he was not going to gallop. \\n The wooden horse got angry when he heard this, and he galloped at full force at the Bankura and banged him with all his might. The Bankura neighed and tried to maintain his balance, but it was too late. He swiveled unsteadily and pitched over the edge of the shelf. \\n “No,” he screamed and fell on the floor with a dull thud. The wooden horse watched in horrified silence and was too afraid to look down, as he was terrified at what he had just done. Slowly he gathered the courage to look down. The Bankura was lying in a basket, with his nose chipped, one of his ears broken and worst of all, one of his legs, was badly cracked. \\n He apologized profusely to the Bankura and pleaded with him to speak with him. But it was of no use, as the Bankura horse lay silent, with a vacant look in his eyes. The wooden horse kept on pleading, but there was no reply. Finally, the wooden horse drew back into a corner of the shelf, full of remorse. \\n The next day, the shop assistant noticed the wooden horse huddled alone in a corner, and wondered where the Bankura horse was. He looked around and spied the horse, lying in the basket. \\n He cried when he saw the broken parts and planned to put him together with some glue. He finally decided to keep him because now nobody would want to purchase him. So, that evening, he took the Bankura horse and the broken pieces home, and fixed him together again. Although he did not look new, the Bankura horse was proud and happy. \\n But the shopkeeper felt that something was missing. He suddenly realized that the Bankura was missing his companion. That evening, he brought home his companion, the wooden horse, who had been sitting forlornly in the shop’s shelf. \\n The wooden horse apologized profusely and said, “I am sorry Bankura, can we be friends again?” \\n Bankura was relieved to hear this and they lived together peacefully on the shelf, and until this day, neither of them tried to gallop again.', '\\n\\n A middle-aged man was wandering in the forest and lost his way back to his group. He was on a tour with his friends. After lunch, he decided to have a small walk. His friends had warned him not to go deep into the jungle as he might lose his way. However, he never cared to hear the advice of his friends. \\n\\n \\n\\n The forest was so beautiful and dense. In spite of warnings, he got lost in the forest. When he turned back after a few minutes, he could see nothing but dense trees without showing the way. He was tensed and tried to walk back. \\n\\n \\n\\n He couldn’t find the way back. Suddenly he heard a mild roaring voice. Frightened by the voice, he walked back. The roar now sounded closer to him. He realized that it was a lion and could see traces of the lion. \\n\\n \\n\\n He rushed and ran faster to save his life from the lion. He saw the lion approaching him. He swiftly climbed a huge and positioned himself comfortably on a high branch. He wasn’t very sure how he climbed the tree. Parallel to the branch that he was seated, he saw a bear sleeping in another branch. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lion saw the tree, the man, and the bear. He asked the bear to push the man down, as he was hungry. \\n\\n \\n\\n The bear humbly replied, ‘Dear Lion, I am sorry I cannot do that. This is my tree, my shelter. He came to me to rescue his life. I cannot let him die and never let him fall!’ Hearing this, the man felt happy. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Lion remained silent for a while. He then asked the man, ‘Hey, push the bear down. I will leave you.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n The man without even thinking for a minute, tried to push the bear. However, the bear was so clever that he hanged to another branched and seated comfortably.\\n\\n \\n\\n The Lion laughed at them and left the place. \\n\\n \\n\\n How wicked was the man? Shame on him. The bear in fact saved his life from the ferocious lion and yet he tried to push him down... \\n\\n \\n\\n Be the bear and help someone who needs you. Don’t be like the man who betrayed the bear.', '\\n AMONG the playmates of my childhood was an Indian girl about twelve years of age. After the Latter- day Saints had left our town, and we could not yet go with them, there were few Mormon children remaining, and our parents did not care to mingle with those who despised our people and our faith. Upon our farm, as was the custom in Southern California, several Indians were employed, and Adela was a daughter of one of the women who did washing and sewing for the white people. Adela\\'s great grandfather and uncle also lived upon our farm, at a convenient distance from the house. Adela went to school with us when she wished, and learned all our songs, also how to crochet lace and make doll clothing. Adela could skip rope the longest, swing the highest, play ball the best, and taught us very pretty games of playing ball. One was like this : As many as chose could form a circle, standing a rod or so apart, and throw the ball to the next. As the circle was very large if the number of girls was seven or eight, and each girl had a ball to throw with one hand and catch another from the next playmate, you can see how pretty it would look, a perfect string of balls flying around the circle all the time. It required a watchful eye and skillful hands to keep the game going without a break, and it was the stillest game of ball I ever knew, while in progress ; but if a \\'catcher missed, it was noisy enough till we got started again. \\n Then Adela could roll hoop the prettiest, always coming out ahead at the end of the lane; climb the highest for a peep into a bird\\'s nest, and dive into deep water where we were almost afraid to look at her. In our bow and arrow practice she could strike the mark oftener than we could, and would send her arrows one after the other like shooting stars, till her quiver was empty. \\n How many a day of innocent and healthful games and pleasures we had together. \\'I do not remember that we ever had a misunderstanding in all our days together. \\n Adela would come early in the morning and sometimes stay till after prayer-time. If I had work or sewing to do first, she helped me. Always gentle and obliging, never rude or obtrusive, Adela was a pattern to many white girls. When her people went into the mountains, and brought back nice things, Adela al- ways brought us some, as though we were one of the family. Adela was very pretty, and her voice was as sweet as one ever heard. \\n We used to coax her to sing Indian songs to us and then tell us their meaning. When Adela was older, she went with her friends on a picnic in the mountains, and while away took sick and died. I sorrowed long after my gentle mate, and can never forget her tender face, graceful form and sweet voice. As Latter-day Saints, we have a knowledge of the history of the Indian races, and look forward to their occupying a more exalted condition. How happy a time that will be, for many of them are worthy, their hearts as loving and sometimes more faithful than ours. \\n Let me tell you about Minnie, an Indian babe. Her mother was a relative of Adela\\'s, perhaps a cousin. The parents of Minnie worked on our farm for seven years. Lisifa, the mother, was of the Cabezon tribe, of California, and Pete, the father, was from the Muddy River tribe, in Nevada. \\n Once, when I was away from home, my mother wrote that Lisifa had a little girl, and desired me to send it a name. I was in Salt Lake City, and replied that I would soon start home, but if the name suited them, call her Minnie. \\n You see I thought that would be easy for them to speak and remember. Well, on my return I found she was a dear little thing, and soon took great interest in her. Her parents had moved into an adobe storehouse of ours, and her mother was a good house-keeper and seamstress and kept her baby more comfortably clothed than many richer babies I know of. Every morning before breakfast Minnie was ready in clean, fresh clothing for anyone to take her, and soon learned to watch for me and hold out her pretty hands. By regular bathing in water in which some fragrant herb had been steeped, Minnie\\'s complexion was much fairer than might have been expected. Her hair shone like black satin, and her eyes were soft and black like a deer\\'s. She used to sit on my lap while I sewed on the machine, and was very cautious not to touch anything, but would watch the movements with great interest. Minnie liked the movement of the treadle and would kick vigorously during a pause for the treadle to \" get up \" again. She often fell asleep, her head resting on her dimpled arms crossed on the machine table. \\n Then I would lay her on the sofa, and cover her with shawl and mosquito-bar. If her mother happened to wonder about her baby, and looked into the room, she would smile and go back to her work. We were all fond of her. As she grew older, when father came home from the office at night, Minnie was always on the lookout, and her little shiny black head could be seen bobbing along the drive, just showing above the fleur-de-lis that bordered each side. \\n Pete was the driver, and father had told him to be watchful or he might sometime drive against her; for the carriage-way was in curves instead of a straight avenue. Pete would jump down and lift her up be- side him, and they were very happy. \"Not like other poor Indian babies,\" he would say appreciatively. Pete wanted Minnie to go to school when old enough, and my parents promised him that it should be so. However, when Minnie was eighteen months old, the way opened for part of our family to come to Utah. \\n Mr. Lord, a good man, promised to do as well by Pete and his family as we had, so there was a good prospect for them. They wanted to take our little hand-cart, that was used for fruit gathering, and come with us. \"I could haul Minnie and our clothes, and Lisifa and I could walk,\" he said; but it was explained to him how we would not have a fine property in Utah, and an income to pay them wages, and that they had best remain with Mr. Lord until we could send for them. Little Minnie was asleep when we came away. Father had to stay behind awhile to collect money not then due. \\n One night someone rapped at his bedroom door. He asked who was there, and the answer was, \"Pete.\" \\n Father arose, and, asking him in, saw that he could hardly speak, for trouble. \" What is it, Pete, tell me, poor boy.\" \\n \" Minnie is dead. They had fly-paper and she put some in her mouth. Mrs. Lord could not save her. Write to the folks.\" Father tried to console him. \" Thank you, Colonel; I guess I go back to her mother.\" And he went alone, his lonely, sad, three miles\\' walk. We wrote to them. Father read the letter aloud and gave it to Pete. They pressed it to their cheeks, put it carefully away, and went home. That was twenty-one years ago. Just lately I heard from them. Pete had been asking an old friend if she knew anything of us. When I answered the lady\\'s letter, I sent my picture, and she showed it to them. \" Most like her mother. Tell her about my boy I\\'ve got.\\'\\' I have written to him that a better day for his people is near at hand, and that he too may yet through knowledge perform a part.', '\\n\\n ONE day Ned got a pie to eat. It was too hot, so he put it out in the air, on the lid of a big tin pot. \\n And now he ran off to see his dog who had a pup, and his cat who had a kit.\\n The pup lay in a box. Ned had got hay to put in the box for a bed; the pup lay on the hay, and the kit lay on a bit of rug.\\n Ned did pat the pup on his ear, and say: \"0 you pet! Let me hug you.\" By and by, he did pat the kit too, arid say; \"Kit, kit, kit, can you eat pie can you? Let me go and get you a bit.\" So he ran to his pie but, my 1 it was not on the lid of the big tin pot.\\n \"Why, who can it be who has got my pie?\" Ned did say. \"Did it fly up in the air?\"\\n Why, Hal! Did you get my pie ?\"\\n \"No, not I. It is a tom-tit you see not a pie.\"\\n \"O yes! So it is, a wee torn-tit. If I can get my pie, the torn-tit, and you and I can eat it.\"\\n He got up on top of the tin pot to see far off, and he did cry out : \" my ! I see it now ! I see my pie ! The sly old ape has got it, and he has eat a big bit out of it, too ! Oh ! oh ! he will eat it all up ! How can I get at him?\"\\n And now the sly old ape, who had the pie in his paw, saw Ned, and Ned did say : \" Now for a run 1\" So he did run, and the sly old ape did run, and the dog did run, and the cat did run, and the pup did run, and the kit did run, and all did run, and it was fun.\\n The ape did say, \"Che ! che!\" and ate the pie as he ran. Ned did say: \"O you bad old ape! O you bad old ape!\" The dog did say: \" Bow wow! Bow wow!\"\\n The cat did say: \"Mew, mew!” The pup did say: \"Yap ! yap !\" and the kit did cry : \"Eee, eee !\" Was it not a big run? \\n And now, was it not too bad in the sly old ape? For you see he ate the pie all up. Ned did not get one bit, and the kit did not get one bit, O my! \\n Let me say to you, if you get a pie, and it is too hot to eat, do not put it on the top of a big tin pot, in the air, and go off to see a cat or a dog, for if you do, may be a sly old ape may get at the pie, and eat it all up.', '\\n\\n ONE day Ben did go up to his papa, and say :\\n \"pa-pa ! my cap is so old, it is not fit to be put on; do buy me a new one!\" \\n His pa-pa did say : \" If you are not bad all day, I can say\\' yes \\' to you, but if you are bad, the old cap will do for a bad boy.\" \\n But Ben was not bad ; so his pa-pa got him the cap. It had fur on it. Ben put it on ; and as it fit him, he ran out in the air, and did cry as he ran : \" See my new cap ! see my new cap!\"\\n Far off, by an old log, he saw a fat hen. She was by her nest. In it was an egg. Ben ran up to her, and he did cry, \" Sho ! sho ! sho 1\" till she did fly off. So he got the old hen\\'s egg, and put it in the top of his cap. As he did so a boy ran up to him. It was Bob. \" Hal-lo,\" Bob did say. \" How do you do, Ben ?\" and he hit him a tap on the top of his cap. He did not see Ben put the egg in his cap ; and, my ! the egg did go pop ! ! and it ran in his ear and his eye, and all on him from top to toe. His new cap was all egg too.\\n So you see how bad it was in him not to let the old fat hen and her egg be. But he did not care a bit ; for he and Bob ran off to see the men mow the hay. It lay in the hot sun to dry.\\n Bob lay on the hay, and the sun was so hot, that the end of his nose got red, and a big dog who was by the men saw the end of his nose, and ran and made a snap at it to eat it. But Ben did hop up, and he and Bob ran off.\\n Ben did go in to his mamma and say : \" mam-ma ! we are so hot and so dry ! do let us get a pie to eat and a big tin mug of wa-ter ; and oh ! may we put a big bit of ice in the tin mug ?\"\\n His mam-ma did say, Yes ; and so Ben and Bob did eat the pie and had a lot of fun ; for Ben bit his pie to look like a cat who had one leg, and Bob bit his pie in-to a dog who had one ear. He ate it all up; and Bob did say he had a dog-pie, and Ben had a cat-pie. Was it not fun?\\n But his pa-pa did say to him : \" Why, Ben, how did you get all the egg on you?\" O how red Ben was! But he did not say a lie. no ! He did say : \"Pa-pa, I got an egg and put it in the top of my new cap, but Bob did not see it, and he did tap the top of my cap, and the egg did go pop ! all on me, and the top of my new cap is all egg. How can I get it off?\"\\n His pa-pa was full of joy, as his son did not say a lie, and he did try to get all the egg off of the new cap. And now Ben and Bob ran off, and Ben had a lot of fun, for he was not bad ; no ! he was a boy who did not say a lie, and so he had joy and fun all day. If you are not bad, you can have joy and fun too. You are my pet, so I get all the wee wee w-o-r-d-s I can, to put in-to this book for you ; and if I can see you one day and kiss you, I can have joy \\n Too, too, too;\\n\\n If I can see you, you, you:\\n\\n Will you come ? Oh ! do, do, do !\\n I will let you hop, hop, hop,\\n\\n Run or spin your top, top, top,\\n\\n Get a gun and pop, pop, pop,\\n Go out in the sun, sun, sun,\\n\\n With my kit to run, run, run :\\n\\n \"Will we not have fun, fun, fun ?\\n You can see my cat, cat, cat,\\n\\n And her soft fur pat, pat, pat\\n\\n She is on the mat, mat, mat.\\n Out on the old rug, rug, rug,\\n\\n Is my pet dog Pug, Pug, Pug\\n\\n Give him a good hug, hug, hug.\\n If you stub your toe, ttoe, toe,\\n\\n When to him you go, go, go,\\n\\n You will come to woe, woe, woe.\\n It will hurt you so, so, so,\\n\\n You will cry : \" Oh oh ! oh oh !\\n\\n Is my toe off?\" \"No, no, no;\\n \" For I see it yet, yet, yet ;\\n\\n Here it is, my pet, pet, pet ;\\n\\n But your face is wet, wet, wet.\\n U O my dear! don\\'t cry, cry, cry;\\n\\n Kiss me now, and try, try, try\\n\\n To be good as pie, pie, pie.\\n \" I will wipe your eye, eye, eye,\\n\\n Make it nice and dry; dry, dry,\\n\\n Just like the blue sky, sky, sky.\\n \"Do not look so shy, shy, shy,\\n\\n As your hat I tie, tie, tie ;\\n\\n O dear me ! oh ! why, why, why\\n \" Must you go ?

Let me see if mamma will let us. Yes, we can go: so you put on a hat, and let me get my cap, and we can run all the way.\"\\n Ben got his cap off of the peg, and Sue got her hat out of a box; and the two ran off. Tip, the big dog, ran too.\\n On the top of the see-saw sat an old cat; she sat on it, to try to spy out a rat, who had hid. The cat did not see Tip ; and, I am sad to say, he was now a bad dog ; for he ran at her, and bit her in the leg.\\n The cat put up her paw to hit Tip, and Tip bit her in her ear; and the cat had to run off with a m-e-w! my! was not Tip a bad dog ? \\n And now Sue and Ben got on the see-saw. Sue did go up, up, up, and Ben did go up, up, up. And it was fun ! Was it not?\\n Tip had his fun too, for he saw the rat. It had hid in a box by the see-saw, and the cat did not see it; but Tip did ; and oh 1 how he did fly at it! He got it in his paw and bit it, so it did die. The rat did not say it was fun to be out at the see-saw, as Ben and Sue did. No! It was no fun at all to be bit, and to die. Was it?\\n And now the sun was hot, and Ben and Sue got off the see-saw and ran up to the old red cow, to see her eat hay, and out to the pig sty to see the old fat pig, who ate all day.\\n “My!\" Sue did say,\" see how fat the pig is! All she can do is to eat all day. I cannot eat all day ; can you Ben ?\"\\n \"Why, no,” Ben did say, \"But I can eat one big pie in a day.\"\\n \"Oh! so can I! Let us go in and ask mamma for a pie to eat now.\"\\n So the two ran, and Tip ran. And mamma had a pie; she cut it up for Sue and Ben to eat, and they did hop for joy and eat it all up.\\n \"Did they? No I cannot say so, for Ben gave Tip, the dog, a big bit; and Sue did too. Ben was not a pig, and Sue was not a pig. So, you see, the two did not eat as the pig did; no! for Tip had his bit too.\\n Out on the log \\n\\n The sly old cat \\n\\n Did sit all day, \\n\\n To get a rat.\\n But Tip, the dog, \\n\\n Did run at her, \\n\\n And in his paw \\n\\n He got her fur. \\n She had to fly, \\n\\n The sly old cat; \\n\\n And now the dog \\n\\n Has got the rat.', \"\\n\\n Do you know the favorite food of Japanese? They love Sushi! Sushi is nothing but raw fish sliced in different shapes and sizes. \\n\\n \\n\\n Of course, fresh produces are tasty aren't they? Japanese loved to eat the fresh fish. The market for fresh fish in Japan grew so big that fishermen earned a good deal in catching fresh fish. \\n\\n \\n\\n Weeks and months passed by! The fishermen were unable to get fresh fish quickly. They took their boats to longer distance in the sea. The fishing boats became big to feed the fish lovers and the fishermen moved farther and farther to bring the fresh fish. Since they traveled for many days to get the fish, it took more days for the fishermen to return home. The fish lost its freshness, and Japanese consumers didn’t like the taste of fish that wasn’t fresh. \\n\\n \\n\\n The fish companies tried to solve the problem and installed freezers to keep the fish fresh. They installed the freezers in the boats to store the fish fresh. Unfortunately, the frozen fish couldn’t meet the flavor profile of the Japanese who always loved to eat the fish fresh. \\n\\n \\n\\n Of course, the flavor of fresh foods and frozen foods differ a lot! \\n\\n \\n\\n Next, the fishing companies installed large fish tanks in the boat. Soon after the fishermen caught the fish, they were put in the fish tanks and kept alive. The fish stuffed in the tanks, as they thrashed around for a while and got tired and dull in the tanks. Furthermore, a few fish died in the tanks, which ruined the other fish too! \\n\\n \\n\\n The fishing industry experienced a big crisis! However, they found a solution to this problem. Now, Japanese could enjoy the fresh fish now. What happened? \\n\\n \\n\\n The fishing companies put the caught fish directly into the fish tanks installed on the boats. However, they made a small change. They also included a small shark in the fish tank. This kept the fish very active and made them stay fresh! \\n\\n \\n\\n Challenges are important to achieve many things!\", 'Dadu was a seven year old boy. He was naughty, funny and very mischievous.

They would play, eat and rest near the river. The surrounding area had lush green grass and fruit trees, which served food for the elephants. \\n However, when summer came, the river dried up. There were no more fruits or lush grass left. \\n All the elephants reached out to their master and cried. “Oh! Our Lord! There is no water left in the river. Our infants are facing death and hunger. If we don’t move from here, surely we all will die.” The King replied, “I know a place, where there is adequate water. We all can quench our thirst there.” \\n The very next morning, the elephants started their journey. After traveling for five days and five nights, finally, the elephants reached their destination. As expected, there was a large lake with plenty of water. \\n However, there were large numbers of holes near the banks of the lake. These holes belonged to a family of hares who lived there happily. \\n After seeing plenty of water, the elephants jumped and rolled with joy. In doing so, they destroyed the homes of so many hares. Many of the hares got injured. The hares who ran away managed to save themselves from their wrath. The elephants didn’t care about anyone. The hares found themselves helpless against the mighty elephants. \\n After the elephants went back into the jungle, the hares had a meeting. They were aware that the elephants are very powerful and they cannot beat them physically. So, they decided that it's better to run away in order to save themselves from their wrath. \\n However, one clever hare disagreed and said, “No, we can’t leave this place. This is our ancestral home. We have been living here from generation to generation. We must think of some plan to evacuate them forever. Though we are small, with a clever plan, we can expel them”. \\n After explaining his plan, all the hares agreed to help. As per his plan, one hare went to the hilltop. When the king elephant arrived, a hare shouted, “You devil, you are forbidden to enter the lake. Yesterday, you cruel elephants trampled innocent hares with your foot. This lake belongs to the Moon-God.” \\n “Your selfish act invited the ire of the Moon-God. I am the messenger of Moon-God, he has sent me to convey to you his message. If you want to survive, then don’t even think about coming near the lake again,” he further said. \\n The king elephant replied, “I am sorry, for my sinful act. Oh, Moon-God! Please forgive me!!” The clever hare sitting on the hill replied, “If you want to be forgiven, come to the lake and ask me for forgiveness. You must also offer condolences to the king of hares.” The elephant king walked up to the lake, where saw the reflection of Moon. \\n He immediately asked the MOON for forgiveness. He also said sorry to the king of hares, who was waiting for him, as per their plan. \\n After that, the elephant group never come back to the lake again. The hares lived on happily forever. \\n MORAL: From intelligence, one can overcome even the biggest problem.\", 'Once upon a time, there was an old snake. His name was Mandavishya. He used to live in a jungle. He was too old to hunt his food. So he thought of an idea to manage his need for food. He reached a pond near the mountains. There were large numbers of frogs living there. He lay down there, lying carelessly. On seeing the snake; initially, the frogs ran away out of fear. But they returned back as soon as they realized that snake had no intention to hunt them. \\n One of them gathered enough courage and asked the old snake. “Oh, sir! Why you are lying here and not hunting the frogs?” The snake replied sadly, “I am cursed. Yesterday I was hunting for food and it was my bad luck, I bit the Brahmin’s son. He became very angry and cursed me that from now on you can’t hunt your prey. He cursed me that I can’t hunt the frogs otherwise I will die. So now I am bound to serve the frogs as my masters. I will give a free ride to you as you are my masters now.” One eager frog hopped around the snake’s back and went for a long ride in and around the pond. This news spread among the frogs and their King. The King immediately reached the pond and asked the snake for a ride. The snake replied very humbly and gave a joyful ride to the King and his ministers. The next day the snake was crawling very slowly. The King frog asked the snake, “Why you are walking so slowly?” The snake replied sadly, “My master, I have not eaten anything since last 10 days!!” On hearing this, the King frog decided that every day the snake will be offered a frog so that he can give a speedy ride to the King. Gradually, the snake gained his lost strength and frog population started decreasing day by day.\\n One day, a black snake reached the pond. He was very surprised to see a snake giving joyful rides to the frogs. He inquired the old snake; “Why are you giving a jolly ride to all the frogs when they are our prey”. “Every day, I am getting a frog without hunting, which is enough for satiating my hunger,” the snake replied.\\n “As I am old now, I am getting free food without hunting every day. Therefore I’m enjoying these free meals!” he added.\\n As time passed, the snake became very strong and healthy. The King frog was completely taken in by the old snake’s clever plan. He was unable to understand the real motive behind the snake’s plan of giving free rides. And one day came when he had eaten all the frogs! \\n Then he started eating the ministers of the King Frog. At last, one day, the snake ate the King Frog. The old snake Mandavishya had finally eaten all the frogs, that too with minimal effort!\\n This story gives us a strong morale:\\n “NEVER EVER BELIEVE YOUR ENEMIES, NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY PROMISE YOU THE GAINS”', '\\n A Lame Man is a short funny story about how hastily people come into a conclusion without thinking.

They decided to ask the lame man about the cause of his limping. \\n\\n \\n\\n The first man said, ‘We have been watching you for a while. I told my friend that you were limping because you could have been born lame, but my friend argues that you were injured in an accident! Which one is true? Please tell us?’\\n\\n \\n\\n The lame man laughed at them and replied, ‘I’m not lame.

A long drive, followed by hunting for about few minutes always attracted Sonu. The reason was Sonu’s father used to boast about his hunting prowess and good stories. Often, he would return home carrying a bird or a rabbit. \\n\\n \\n\\n One day, his father was preparing for a hunt. Sonu was very keen to go with him. He asked his father to take him along, as he was bored at home. His father took Sonu with him to the hunt. \\n\\n \\n\\n They drove a long way before they reached a lake. It was a big lake surrounded by many animals. Birds, monkeys, rabbits, and other tiny animals were sheltered by the lake. Sonu’s father was trying to hit a rabbit, but couldn’t do it. He tried many times, but could not even hit a single animal. Sonu became more bored more than he was at home. He asked his father to quit so that they could get back home. \\n\\n \\n\\n They drove back home. Sonu’s mother was surprised to see them return so soon after hunting. When they returned, there were few guests waiting for them at home. They asked them what they got in their hunting trip. As Sonu didn’t want to damage the self-image of his father, he decided to take matters into his hands. \\n\\n \\n\\n Sonu replied, ‘Mommy do you know that Dad is a great hunter! He hunted two targets at the same time!’\\n\\n \\n\\n His father remained silent. His mother became curious to know. Sonu then added, ‘Mom he shot at the head and toe of the duck simultaneously!’ \\n\\n \\n\\n Even the father was surprised to hear it as so were their guests. \\n\\n \\n\\n One guest happened to ask Sonu, ‘Where is the duck? Shooting at the head and toe together is not possible.’\\n\\n \\n\\n Sonu broke the surprise, ‘The duck was scratching the toe with its head near the lake. My dad shot at the duck’s head. Therefore, it hit the head as well as toe and the duck fell in the water! That’s two targets in one shot!’ \\n\\n \\n\\n It left everyone speechless, even Sonu’s father.', '\\n\\n Alex the lion lived in the jungle. He was big, strong and had a flowing mane. He also had the mightiest and loudest roar in the jungle, and one, which could be heard for miles around. Alex was indeed a splendid creature, but he was depressed and terribly unhappy. He suffered from a small problem that he was not able to solve. Alex had recurring bouts of hiccups.\\n It was a bad case, because it never left him. It followed him everywhere. It affected his hunting, stalking and even when he was relaxing. Alex was ready to try just about anything to cure his hiccups.\\n At first, Alex just ignored them, thinking that it would go away after a good night’s sleep. However, he was wrong. The moment he woke up the next morning and had something to drink, it would start again. Alex grew terribly depressed day by day.\\n One morning, when the hiccups resumed, he decided to clamp his mouth firmly and thought, “I shall not open my mouth and the hiccups will not be able to escape.” Although, it did stop for a few seconds, the hiccups sneaked through his gullet and resumed violently. Poor Alex, he just did not know what to do. He became even more depressed.\\n He went to see his friend Melman the Giraffe. He thought as Melman had a long neck, he surely would have an answer to his problem.\\n “Hello Alex, why are you so quiet today?” asked Melman.\\n Alex shrugged despondently, “I have got the hiccups, and I have just about tried everything. It just does not seem to go away. Perhaps, you can suggest a way to get rid of them,” said Alex.\\n “Hiccups,” said Melman, “What in the world are they?”\\n “Just watch me,” said Alex. Melman the Giraffe bent down and stared curiously at Alex. Suddenly, Alex let out three loud hiccups, “Hic, Hic, and Hic.”\\n “Oh dear me, that is really peculiar. You do seem to have a problem there,” said Melman the Giraffe.\\n “What can I do about it?” asked Alex. “Do you know of any solution to my problem?”\\n Melman the Giraffe pondered for a while and said, “I think you have this problem, because you have such a small neck. If you had a long neck like mine, I don’t think you would ever get this problem. Do you think you can make your neck a bit longer?”\\n “No,” growled Alex angrily. “Besides, I like my neck the way it is.”\\n “Too bad,” said Melman the Giraffe. “I think you would then be stuck with the hiccups.”\\n Melman got a bit curt and walked away, leaving Alex behind with his hiccups.\\n Just then, Bono the rabbit happened to dart across. \\n “Hey you,” growled Alex, “Come over here.”\\n Bono looked at Alex and trembled. \\n “Don’t be afraid of me,” thundered Alex. Just then, he got a bad attack of his hiccups. The hiccups interrupted their conversation.\\n “I need some advice,” said Alex. “Do you know a method to get rid of these hiccups?”\\n Bono the rabbit watched curiously and said, “You are a big and mighty lion. Why don’t you frighten them away?”\\n “How?” asked Alex.\\n “By roaring, of course.” Said Bono.\\n That seemed a good idea, thought Alex.\\n Between hiccups, he let out two mighty roars. Roars, so powerful, that it shook the jungle. Bono ran off, when he heard the echo. Even, Alex got a bit frightened. For a minute, the hiccups stopped, and Alex was thrilled. Then a minute later, he felt the familiar twitch and it again re-started.\\n Alex, searched for Bono, but he was nowhere to be seen. He realized that there was no point blaming Bono.\\n Bambi, the deer who was watching all this came and told Alex that it was stupid if he thought he could frighten the hiccup off with a roar.\\n “Then how do I get rid of them?” asked Alex desperately.\\n “Well, by running away them of course,” she said. “Whenever something bothers me, I just run away from it.”\\n Alex thought about this for a while and it seemed like a good idea. “Perhaps, if I run fast enough, I could get away from the hiccups,” he thought.\\n And so, Alex started running. “Faster, faster,” said Bambi, who was running beside him.\\n Alex ran with all his might with his splendid mane flying through the air, and all the animals giving way for him. Alex ran until he was exhausted. Wearily he sat down and noticed that his hiccups had gone. “I have done it at last,” said Alex.\\n He went down to the stream for a drink and drank until his stomach was full. No sooner, he finished drinking, the familiar twitch returned, and the hiccups started again.\\n Poor Alex, he burst in to tears. He was sobbing so hard between his hiccups, when Smarty the Jackal passed by and could not help wonder the reason for Alex’s sadness.\\n “What’s the problem, Alex?” asked Smarty.\\n Alex then narrated his tale of woe and Smarty the jackal started laughing so hard, that made Alex angry.\\n “You know, what your problem is Alex? You have hiccups because you don’t laugh enough,” said Smarty.\\n “How can I laugh, when there is nothing funny to laugh about?” quipped Alex.\\n “Well, there is always something funny to laugh about. For example, who has ever heard of a lion with hiccups?” said Smarty, and he started laughing.\\n Alex thought for a while and Smarty’s laughter was so infectious that he too could not help laughing.\\n He laughed so much that he was rolling in the ground with laughter.\\n Suddenly, Smarty said, “That was fun wasn’t it, and did you notice that your hiccups too have vanished?”\\n Alex got up with a start and realized that what Smarty said was correct. He waited for a minute and it did not reappear.\\n “I have got rid of the hiccups and began to laugh all over again,” he cried.\\n To this day, Alex did never have hiccups, although he laughs a little every day, just in case they might strike again.', '\\n\\n ONCE when traveling, we were \" snowed in,\" and as there were prospects of bad roads for weeks yet, we rented a room in a nice little rock house, in which lived a small family. Of the three children, Johnny, who was next to the baby, was a robust little fellow three years old, and he was such a chatter-box that we found great entertainment in listening to him, and al- ways found him truthful, too, which is a rare quality in \"story-telling.\" \\n Johnny used to come in to see us very early in the morning, and we were fond of having him take break- fast with us, it was such a novelty to watch his energetic way of speaking and gesticulating. \\n Sometimes his mother hastened after him, fearing that we were becoming annoyed, but it was not so. One morning, after another heavy snowfall, a tap was heard, and, opening the door, there stood Johnny, in great haste to tell us something. \"Well, Johnny, sit down with us to breakfast, and tell us while we eat.\" \\n Johnny climbed upon the pillow which sister placed on the chair for his benefit, and began, \" I killed a bear ! \" \" You didn\\'t do anything of the kind! \" said sister, but Johnny looked as dead in ear- nest as a boy could look, and answered quietly and firmly, \\'\\'I did.\" \\n \"Tell us all about it,\" said ma, who always believed in giving children a chance. \"Was it a toy bear?\" I asked. \"No, it wasn\\'t; it was a true bear, as big as a big calf, and you ought to have heard it roar ! My ! \" And Johnny stood up on the round of the chair and held up his arms. \"You\\'d better sit down ; you\\'ll lose your balance,\" said sister. Johnny sat down and proceeded to fill his cheeks with a piece of pie. His eyes roamed from one to the other, and when he had managed to swallow the greater portion, so that breathing became less difficult, he was going to resume, but his mother knocked and came in. \"O Johnny, what makes you do like this? I\\'m ashamed of you ! \" \" Never mind, he\\'s welcome, and he was just going to tell us something very wonderful,\" said ma. \"That bear I killed \"he began. \"Johnny Layton,\" interrupted his mother, \"what do you mean by talking like that ? \" \"I ain\\'t talking like that ; that bear I killed \" \"Oh, you little story-teller ! sticking to it when you know we all know better. You never saw a bear; you don\\'t know what they\\'re like.\" \"I do! I\\'ve seen their pictures, lots of \\'em.\" The laugh which followed this speech did not disconcert Johnny; he had proved that he knew what a bear looked like, and it would be easy enough to prove the rest. Ma looked kindly at Johnny, and he resumed: \"That bear I killed \" \"Johnny, don\\'t tell any more, or I\\'ll have to whip you for story -telling; it\\'s time to quit now.\" \\n \"I think we had better hear the story. I think it will come out all right,\" said ma, and Johnny began again and rushed right through. \"That bear I killed was up in Pine Valley, where I went with my pa to get a load of wood. [The auditors glanced at each other.] My pa had gone for the horses to bring home the wood, and that bear came right out behind a tree and jumped at our wagon, and when I hollered at him he stopped!\" Johnny took no discouragement from his mother\\'s mortified expression, my amazement, nor sister\\'s look, which said plainly enough, \"You little fibber !\" but went on : \"Then he come! a- jumping, and I climbed on the load, and jumped on him and killed him ! \" There was no mistaking his earnestness; he fairly glowed with excitement. \" He\\'s going to be sick with brain fever,\" said the mother tremulously. \\n \"Was it after you had the molasses candy, Johnny? \" inquired ma. \" Yes, I went off and left my candy, and I want it now,\" and Johnny began to slide down, and was soon out of the room. \"It was all a dream! I wouldn\\'t scold him; he believes it every bit.\" \"O Sister J., perhaps he did dream that ; he awoke with a scream, and, as soon as he dressed, he ran in here,\" said Johnny\\'s mother, smiling in relief. By this time he was back with his candy, and no one made any further effort to induce him to retract his statement. Johnny appeared satisfied at having finished the narrative, and at our having been unable to deprive him of the honor of the occasion. \\n When Johnny grew older, of course he was able to understand the wide difference between dreams and realities.']\n",

They were good students. \\n One evening, Jack and Dane were playing with a ball. After a while, Jack said, “I am so bored. Shall we go for fishing in the river?”\\n “That is a great idea,” replied Dane. \\n Jack called out to his mother,” Mama, we are going fishing in the river, okay?”\\n “Okay,” Jack’s mother said, “but be careful not to get into the water. Your father said there are crocodiles in the river.”\\n Both the children said that they would not get into the river. They gathered their fishing lines with the hooks, and a can full of bait. They strolled to the river, and soon began fishing. \\n However, even after a long time, they did not get any fish. They began to feel bored again. “This river looks not so deep. Why does mother say not to swim here?” asked Jack.\\n “Remember, your mother said there are crocodiles here,” said Dane.\\n “Well, I don’t find any,” said Jack.\\n Dane was quiet for a while. Finally he asked, “Do you think we can swim?”\\n Jack jumped up and shouted excitedly, “Yes, let us swim. Come on, dive.”\\n The two friends dove in, and splashed around happily. They found some logs of wood floating on the river, and tried floating with them. It was then that something unexpected happened. \\n Dane was playing with a log of wood, and suddenly, the log was caught in a strong current, and he was hit in the head. He became unconscious immediately. \\n Jack saw what happened, and he swam fast to his friend’s rescue. However, Dane was too heavy for Jack to drag to the shore, so he shouted for help.\\n “Help! My friend is drowning.”\\n At the same time, he saw a movement a little far away. He realized he was looking at a crocodile and was terrified. \\n He began to panic and to cry. The crocodile was going to get them any moment. \\n Suddenly a loud splash was heard. Jack looked up to see his father and mother in the river, by his side. In a flash, they got both the friends to the shore.\\n They sprinkled some water on Dane’s face and brought him back to consciousness, but he was very weak. Jack was too shocked to speak. He felt very guilty. Finally, he stammered, “I am sorry, father. I will listen to you and mother in the future. Promise.”\\n The friends learnt a lesson.\\n Moral: Children who disobey their parents will get into trouble.\\n', '\\n\\n Once upon a time, there were two horses, which lived together on a shelf. However, these were not real horses, that lived and breathed, but they were real in another sort of way. The shelf they lived in was in a big shop. There, they were waiting for someone to come and purchase them.\\n One of the horses was a fine wooden horse, carved out of a single block of wood. He had a muscular body with athletic legs, and a magnificent carved mane. His body was rubbed smooth with sandpaper and he was deep brownish in color. The other horse was a Bankura Horse. He had a thickset body, four short perfectly shaped legs, and a very long, long neck. He was also brown, but he was made of clay, instead of wood. \\n One day the wooden horse, bored with sitting on the stand, stuck up a conversation with the Bankura horse. He told the Bankura that he was bored of sitting on that shelf all day, gathering dust and doing nothing. \\n The Bankura horse replied meekly that he was quite happy sitting around and that he liked it there. The wooden horse once again snorted and complained that he did not like that place and that he hated it there. He was going to do something about it and was planning to go galloping. The Bankura was lost as to what galloping was, and asked the wooden horse as to what it meant. \\n The wooden sighed at his companion’s ignorance, albeit innocence, all the while shaking his mane. He was lost as to how he came to be a horse, not knowing what galloping was. He then added that galloping came natural to horses and it was all horses did, i.e., to run at nice, fast pace. \\n The Bankura was a bit apprehensive, when he heard about running, as he said it was something that he definitely could not do. “Aw, don’t be such a spoil sport. I am sure you would love it. That is what all horses do,” said the wooden horse. \\n The terracotta horse insisted that he was afraid, as it was something that he could not do. He insisted that he was built to stand still and not to move around. He went on to say that, he could fall, if he tried to gallop and would break into a hundred pieces. \\n The wooden pooh-poohed all this and called it as nonsense. He insisted that the Bankura was such a fine horse and that horses were meant to gallop. He commended on the Bankura’s strong body and long legs! He said that they were perfect for galloping and asked him to get ready to gallop. \\n The Bankura horse was still not satisfied. \\n The wooden horse continued to try and persuade the Bankura to at least to try and walk. Then the wooden horse slowly clop-clopped, up and down on the shelf. The Bankura had to admit, it was not so difficult, and saying so, he soon got down to it. Soon he too was moving, but not as fluid as the wooden horse. He found it difficult to balance and found it stiff and rather uncomfortable. \\n “Bravo!” commended the wooden horse enthusiastically and was extremely pleased at the Bankura’s effort, and said that he will soon be galloping around in no time. \\n But the Bankura insisted that he was not sure as to whether to continue, as he did not like it very much. \\n The wooden horse was angry and was having none of this nonsense. He snapped decisively and ordered the Bankura to continue. The Bankura horse had no choice but to continue walk up and down. But, his steps continued to be jerky and uneven. \\n After a while, the wooden horse felt that the Bankura had enough of practice, and that it was time to gallop. He then advised the Bankura to watch him gallop. \\n He pranced up and down on the shelf. First, he quickened his steps to a canter and then he burst into a great speed as he galloped up and down on the shelf. Finally, he stopped and looked at the Bankura horse. \\n The Bankura watched with awe at the wooden horse galloping. Although that was something he did want to try, he knew it was just not meant for him. The wooden horse then ordered the Bankura to try it. However, the Bankura refused as he felt that his legs were not meant for galloping and that he could likely fall down. \\n Again, he pooh-poohed and ordered the Bankura to get on with it. However, the Bankura refused to move and said that he was not going to gallop. \\n The wooden horse got angry when he heard this, and he galloped at full force at the Bankura and banged him with all his might. The Bankura neighed and tried to maintain his balance, but it was too late. He swiveled unsteadily and pitched over the edge of the shelf. \\n “No,” he screamed and fell on the floor with a dull thud. The wooden horse watched in horrified silence and was too afraid to look down, as he was terrified at what he had just done. Slowly he gathered the courage to look down. The Bankura was lying in a basket, with his nose chipped, one of his ears broken and worst of all, one of his legs, was badly cracked. \\n He apologized profusely to the Bankura and pleaded with him to speak with him. But it was of no use, as the Bankura horse lay silent, with a vacant look in his eyes. The wooden horse kept on pleading, but there was no reply. Finally, the wooden horse drew back into a corner of the shelf, full of remorse. \\n The next day, the shop assistant noticed the wooden horse huddled alone in a corner, and wondered where the Bankura horse was. He looked around and spied the horse, lying in the basket. \\n He cried when he saw the broken parts and planned to put him together with some glue. He finally decided to keep him because now nobody would want to purchase him. So, that evening, he took the Bankura horse and the broken pieces home, and fixed him together again. Although he did not look new, the Bankura horse was proud and happy. \\n But the shopkeeper felt that something was missing. He suddenly realized that the Bankura was missing his companion. That evening, he brought home his companion, the wooden horse, who had been sitting forlornly in the shop’s shelf. \\n The wooden horse apologized profusely and said, “I am sorry Bankura, can we be friends again?” \\n Bankura was relieved to hear this and they lived together peacefully on the shelf, and until this day, neither of them tried to gallop again.', '\\n\\n A middle-aged man was wandering in the forest and lost his way back to his group. He was on a tour with his friends. After lunch, he decided to have a small walk. His friends had warned him not to go deep into the jungle as he might lose his way. However, he never cared to hear the advice of his friends. \\n\\n \\n\\n The forest was so beautiful and dense. In spite of warnings, he got lost in the forest. When he turned back after a few minutes, he could see nothing but dense trees without showing the way. He was tensed and tried to walk back. \\n\\n \\n\\n He couldn’t find the way back. Suddenly he heard a mild roaring voice. Frightened by the voice, he walked back. The roar now sounded closer to him. He realized that it was a lion and could see traces of the lion. \\n\\n \\n\\n He rushed and ran faster to save his life from the lion. He saw the lion approaching him. He swiftly climbed a huge and positioned himself comfortably on a high branch. He wasn’t very sure how he climbed the tree. Parallel to the branch that he was seated, he saw a bear sleeping in another branch. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lion saw the tree, the man, and the bear. He asked the bear to push the man down, as he was hungry. \\n\\n \\n\\n The bear humbly replied, ‘Dear Lion, I am sorry I cannot do that. This is my tree, my shelter. He came to me to rescue his life. I cannot let him die and never let him fall!’ Hearing this, the man felt happy. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Lion remained silent for a while. He then asked the man, ‘Hey, push the bear down. I will leave you.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n The man without even thinking for a minute, tried to push the bear. However, the bear was so clever that he hanged to another branched and seated comfortably.\\n\\n \\n\\n The Lion laughed at them and left the place. \\n\\n \\n\\n How wicked was the man? Shame on him. The bear in fact saved his life from the ferocious lion and yet he tried to push him down... \\n\\n \\n\\n Be the bear and help someone who needs you. Don’t be like the man who betrayed the bear.', '\\n Among the playmates of my childhood was an Indian girl about twelve years of age. After the Latter- day Saints had left our town, and we could not yet go with them, there were few Mormon children remaining, and our parents did not care to mingle with those who despised our people and our faith. Upon our farm, as was the custom in Southern California, several Indians were employed, and Adela was a daughter of one of the women who did washing and sewing for the white people. Adela\\'s great grandfather and uncle also lived upon our farm, at a convenient distance from the house. Adela went to school with us when she wished, and learned all our songs, also how to crochet lace and make doll clothing. Adela could skip rope the longest, swing the highest, play ball the best, and taught us very pretty games of playing ball. One was like this : As many as chose could form a circle, standing a rod or so apart, and throw the ball to the next. As the circle was very large if the number of girls was seven or eight, and each girl had a ball to throw with one hand and catch another from the next playmate, you can see how pretty it would look, a perfect string of balls flying around the circle all the time. It required a watchful eye and skillful hands to keep the game going without a break, and it was the stillest game of ball I ever knew, while in progress ; but if a \\'catcher missed, it was noisy enough till we got started again. \\n Then Adela could roll hoop the prettiest, always coming out ahead at the end of the lane; climb the highest for a peep into a bird\\'s nest, and dive into deep water where we were almost afraid to look at her. In our bow and arrow practice she could strike the mark oftener than we could, and would send her arrows one after the other like shooting stars, till her quiver was empty. \\n How many a day of innocent and healthful games and pleasures we had together. \\'I do not remember that we ever had a misunderstanding in all our days together. \\n Adela would come early in the morning and sometimes stay till after prayer-time. If I had work or sewing to do first, she helped me. Always gentle and obliging, never rude or obtrusive, Adela was a pattern to many white girls. When her people went into the mountains, and brought back nice things, Adela al- ways brought us some, as though we were one of the family. Adela was very pretty, and her voice was as sweet as one ever heard. \\n We used to coax her to sing Indian songs to us and then tell us their meaning. When Adela was older, she went with her friends on a picnic in the mountains, and while away took sick and died. I sorrowed long after my gentle mate, and can never forget her tender face, graceful form and sweet voice. As Latter-day Saints, we have a knowledge of the history of the Indian races, and look forward to their occupying a more exalted condition. How happy a time that will be, for many of them are worthy, their hearts as loving and sometimes more faithful than ours. \\n Let me tell you about Minnie, an Indian babe. Her mother was a relative of Adela\\'s, perhaps a cousin. The parents of Minnie worked on our farm for seven years. Lisifa, the mother, was of the Cabezon tribe, of California, and Pete, the father, was from the Muddy River tribe, in Nevada. \\n Once, when I was away from home, my mother wrote that Lisifa had a little girl, and desired me to send it a name. I was in Salt Lake City, and replied that I would soon start home, but if the name suited them, call her Minnie. \\n You see I thought that would be easy for them to speak and remember. Well, on my return I found she was a dear little thing, and soon took great interest in her. Her parents had moved into an adobe storehouse of ours, and her mother was a good house-keeper and seamstress and kept her baby more comfortably clothed than many richer babies I know of. Every morning before breakfast Minnie was ready in clean, fresh clothing for anyone to take her, and soon learned to watch for me and hold out her pretty hands. By regular bathing in water in which some fragrant herb had been steeped, Minnie\\'s complexion was much fairer than might have been expected. Her hair shone like black satin, and her eyes were soft and black like a deer\\'s. She used to sit on my lap while I sewed on the machine, and was very cautious not to touch anything, but would watch the movements with great interest. Minnie liked the movement of the treadle and would kick vigorously during a pause for the treadle to \" get up \" again. She often fell asleep, her head resting on her dimpled arms crossed on the machine table. \\n Then I would lay her on the sofa, and cover her with shawl and mosquito-bar. If her mother happened to wonder about her baby, and looked into the room, she would smile and go back to her work. We were all fond of her. As she grew older, when father came home from the office at night, Minnie was always on the lookout, and her little shiny black head could be seen bobbing along the drive, just showing above the fleur-de-lis that bordered each side. \\n Pete was the driver, and father had told him to be watchful or he might sometime drive against her; for the carriage-way was in curves instead of a straight avenue. Pete would jump down and lift her up be- side him, and they were very happy. \"Not like other poor Indian babies,\" he would say appreciatively. Pete wanted Minnie to go to school when old enough, and my parents promised him that it should be so. However, when Minnie was eighteen months old, the way opened for part of our family to come to Utah. \\n Mr. Lord, a good man, promised to do as well by Pete and his family as we had, so there was a good prospect for them. They wanted to take our little hand-cart, that was used for fruit gathering, and come with us. \"I could haul Minnie and our clothes, and Lisifa and I could walk,\" he said; but it was explained to him how we would not have a fine property in Utah, and an income to pay them wages, and that they had best remain with Mr. Lord until we could send for them. Little Minnie was asleep when we came away. Father had to stay behind awhile to collect money not then due. \\n One night someone rapped at his bedroom door. He asked who was there, and the answer was, \"Pete.\" \\n Father arose, and, asking him in, saw that he could hardly speak, for trouble. \" What is it, Pete, tell me, poor boy.\" \\n \" Minnie is dead. They had fly-paper and she put some in her mouth. Mrs. Lord could not save her. Write to the folks.\" Father tried to console him. \" Thank you, Colonel; I guess I go back to her mother.\" And he went alone, his lonely, sad, three miles\\' walk. We wrote to them. Father read the letter aloud and gave it to Pete. They pressed it to their cheeks, put it carefully away, and went home. That was twenty-one years ago. Just lately I heard from them. Pete had been asking an old friend if she knew anything of us. When I answered the lady\\'s letter, I sent my picture, and she showed it to them. \" Most like her mother. Tell her about my boy I\\'ve got.\\'\\' I have written to him that a better day for his people is near at hand, and that he too may yet through knowledge perform a part.', '\\n\\n One day Ned got a pie to eat. It was too hot, so he put it out in the air, on the lid of a big tin pot. \\n And now he ran off to see his dog who had a pup, and his cat who had a kit.\\n The pup lay in a box. Ned had got hay to put in the box for a bed; the pup lay on the hay, and the kit lay on a bit of rug.\\n Ned did pat the pup on his ear, and say: \"0 you pet! Let me hug you.\" By and by, he did pat the kit too, arid say; \"Kit, kit, kit, can you eat pie can you? Let me go and get you a bit.\" So he ran to his pie but, my 1 it was not on the lid of the big tin pot.\\n \"Why, who can it be who has got my pie?\" Ned did say. \"Did it fly up in the air?\"\\n Why, Hal! Did you get my pie ?\"\\n \"No, not I. It is a tom-tit you see not a pie.\"\\n \"O yes! So it is, a wee torn-tit. If I can get my pie, the torn-tit, and you and I can eat it.\"\\n He got up on top of the tin pot to see far off, and he did cry out : \" my ! I see it now ! I see my pie ! The sly old ape has got it, and he has eat a big bit out of it, too ! Oh ! oh ! he will eat it all up ! How can I get at him?\"\\n And now the sly old ape, who had the pie in his paw, saw Ned, and Ned did say : \" Now for a run 1\" So he did run, and the sly old ape did run, and the dog did run, and the cat did run, and the pup did run, and the kit did run, and all did run, and it was fun.\\n The ape did say, \"Che ! che!\" and ate the pie as he ran. Ned did say: \"O you bad old ape! O you bad old ape!\" The dog did say: \" Bow wow! Bow wow!\"\\n The cat did say: \"Mew, mew!” The pup did say: \"Yap ! yap !\" and the kit did cry : \"Eee, eee !\" Was it not a big run? \\n And now, was it not too bad in the sly old ape? For you see he ate the pie all up. Ned did not get one bit, and the kit did not get one bit, O my! \\n Let me say to you, if you get a pie, and it is too hot to eat, do not put it on the top of a big tin pot, in the air, and go off to see a cat or a dog, for if you do, may be a sly old ape may get at the pie, and eat it all up.', '\\n\\n One day Ben did go up to his papa, and say :\\n \"pa-pa ! my cap is so old, it is not fit to be put on; do buy me a new one!\" \\n His pa-pa did say : \" If you are not bad all day, I can say\\' yes \\' to you, but if you are bad, the old cap will do for a bad boy.\" \\n But Ben was not bad ; so his pa-pa got him the cap. It had fur on it. Ben put it on ; and as it fit him, he ran out in the air, and did cry as he ran : \" See my new cap ! see my new cap!\"\\n Far off, by an old log, he saw a fat hen. She was by her nest. In it was an egg. Ben ran up to her, and he did cry, \" Sho ! sho ! sho 1\" till she did fly off. So he got the old hen\\'s egg, and put it in the top of his cap. As he did so a boy ran up to him. It was Bob. \" Hal-lo,\" Bob did say. \" How do you do, Ben ?\" and he hit him a tap on the top of his cap. He did not see Ben put the egg in his cap ; and, my ! the egg did go pop ! ! and it ran in his ear and his eye, and all on him from top to toe. His new cap was all egg too.\\n So you see how bad it was in him not to let the old fat hen and her egg be. But he did not care a bit ; for he and Bob ran off to see the men mow the hay. It lay in the hot sun to dry.\\n Bob lay on the hay, and the sun was so hot, that the end of his nose got red, and a big dog who was by the men saw the end of his nose, and ran and made a snap at it to eat it. But Ben did hop up, and he and Bob ran off.\\n Ben did go in to his mamma and say : \" mam-ma ! we are so hot and so dry ! do let us get a pie to eat and a big tin mug of wa-ter ; and oh ! may we put a big bit of ice in the tin mug ?\"\\n His mam-ma did say, Yes ; and so Ben and Bob did eat the pie and had a lot of fun ; for Ben bit his pie to look like a cat who had one leg, and Bob bit his pie in-to a dog who had one ear. He ate it all up; and Bob did say he had a dog-pie, and Ben had a cat-pie. Was it not fun?\\n But his pa-pa did say to him : \" Why, Ben, how did you get all the egg on you?\" O how red Ben was! But he did not say a lie. no ! He did say : \"Pa-pa, I got an egg and put it in the top of my new cap, but Bob did not see it, and he did tap the top of my cap, and the egg did go pop ! all on me, and the top of my new cap is all egg. How can I get it off?\"\\n His pa-pa was full of joy, as his son did not say a lie, and he did try to get all the egg off of the new cap. And now Ben and Bob ran off, and Ben had a lot of fun, for he was not bad ; no ! he was a boy who did not say a lie, and so he had joy and fun all day.

Let me see if mamma will let us. Yes, we can go: so you put on a hat, and let me get my cap, and we can run all the way.\"\\n Ben got his cap off of the peg, and Sue got her hat out of a box; and the two ran off. Tip, the big dog, ran too.\\n On the top of the see-saw sat an old cat; she sat on it, to try to spy out a rat, who had hid. The cat did not see Tip ; and, I am sad to say, he was now a bad dog ; for he ran at her, and bit her in the leg.\\n The cat put up her paw to hit Tip, and Tip bit her in her ear; and the cat had to run off with a m-e-w! my! was not Tip a bad dog ? \\n And now Sue and Ben got on the see-saw. Sue did go up, up, up, and Ben did go up, up, up. And it was fun ! Was it not?\\n Tip had his fun too, for he saw the rat. It had hid in a box by the see-saw, and the cat did not see it; but Tip did ; and oh 1 how he did fly at it! He got it in his paw and bit it, so it did die. The rat did not say it was fun to be out at the see-saw, as Ben and Sue did. No! It was no fun at all to be bit, and to die. Was it?\\n And now the sun was hot, and Ben and Sue got off the see-saw and ran up to the old red cow, to see her eat hay, and out to the pig sty to see the old fat pig, who ate all day.\\n “My!\" Sue did say,\" see how fat the pig is! All she can do is to eat all day. I cannot eat all day ; can you Ben ?\"\\n \"Why, no,” Ben did say, \"But I can eat one big pie in a day.\"\\n \"Oh! so can I!

So, you see, the two did not eat as the pig did; no! for Tip had his bit too.\\n Out on the log \\n\\n The sly old cat \\n\\n Did sit all day, \\n\\n To get a rat.\\n But Tip, the dog, \\n\\n Did run at her, \\n\\n And in his paw \\n\\n He got her fur. \\n She had to fly, \\n\\n The sly old cat; \\n\\n And now the dog \\n\\n Has got the rat.', \"\\n\\n Do you know the favorite food of Japanese? They love Sushi! Sushi is nothing but raw fish sliced in different shapes and sizes. \\n\\n \\n\\n Of course, fresh produces are tasty aren't they? Japanese loved to eat the fresh fish. The market for fresh fish in Japan grew so big that fishermen earned a good deal in catching fresh fish. \\n\\n \\n\\n Weeks and months passed by! The fishermen were unable to get fresh fish quickly. They took their boats to longer distance in the sea. The fishing boats became big to feed the fish lovers and the fishermen moved farther and farther to bring the fresh fish. Since they traveled for many days to get the fish, it took more days for the fishermen to return home. The fish lost its freshness, and Japanese consumers didn’t like the taste of fish that wasn’t fresh. \\n\\n \\n\\n The fish companies tried to solve the problem and installed freezers to keep the fish fresh. They installed the freezers in the boats to store the fish fresh. Unfortunately, the frozen fish couldn’t meet the flavor profile of the Japanese who always loved to eat the fish fresh. \\n\\n \\n\\n Of course, the flavor of fresh foods and frozen foods differ a lot! \\n\\n \\n\\n Next, the fishing companies installed large fish tanks in the boat. Soon after the fishermen caught the fish, they were put in the fish tanks and kept alive. The fish stuffed in the tanks, as they thrashed around for a while and got tired and dull in the tanks. Furthermore, a few fish died in the tanks, which ruined the other fish too! \\n\\n \\n\\n The fishing industry experienced a big crisis! However, they found a solution to this problem. Now, Japanese could enjoy the fresh fish now. What happened? \\n\\n \\n\\n The fishing companies put the caught fish directly into the fish tanks installed on the boats. However, they made a small change. They also included a small shark in the fish tank. This kept the fish very active and made them stay fresh! \\n\\n \\n\\n Challenges are important to achieve many things!\", 'Dadu was a seven year old boy. He was naughty, funny and very mischievous.

They would play, eat and rest near the river. The surrounding area had lush green grass and fruit trees, which served food for the elephants. \\n However, when summer came, the river dried up. There were no more fruits or lush grass left. \\n All the elephants reached out to their master and cried. “Oh! Our Lord! There is no water left in the river. Our infants are facing death and hunger. If we don’t move from here, surely we all will die.” The King replied, “I know a place, where there is adequate water. We all can quench our thirst there.” \\n The very next morning, the elephants started their journey. After traveling for five days and five nights, finally, the elephants reached their destination. As expected, there was a large lake with plenty of water. \\n However, there were large numbers of holes near the banks of the lake. These holes belonged to a family of hares who lived there happily. \\n After seeing plenty of water, the elephants jumped and rolled with joy. In doing so, they destroyed the homes of so many hares. Many of the hares got injured. The hares who ran away managed to save themselves from their wrath. The elephants didn’t care about anyone. The hares found themselves helpless against the mighty elephants. \\n After the elephants went back into the jungle, the hares had a meeting. They were aware that the elephants are very powerful and they cannot beat them physically. So, they decided that it's better to run away in order to save themselves from their wrath. \\n However, one clever hare disagreed and said, “No, we can’t leave this place. This is our ancestral home. We have been living here from generation to generation. We must think of some plan to evacuate them forever. Though we are small, with a clever plan, we can expel them”. \\n After explaining his plan, all the hares agreed to help. As per his plan, one hare went to the hilltop. When the king elephant arrived, a hare shouted, “You devil, you are forbidden to enter the lake. Yesterday, you cruel elephants trampled innocent hares with your foot. This lake belongs to the Moon-God.” \\n “Your selfish act invited the ire of the Moon-God. I am the messenger of Moon-God, he has sent me to convey to you his message. If you want to survive, then don’t even think about coming near the lake again,” he further said. \\n The king elephant replied, “I am sorry, for my sinful act. Oh, Moon-God! Please forgive me!!” The clever hare sitting on the hill replied, “If you want to be forgiven, come to the lake and ask me for forgiveness. You must also offer condolences to the king of hares.” The elephant king walked up to the lake, where saw the reflection of Moon. \\n He immediately asked the MOON for forgiveness. He also said sorry to the king of hares, who was waiting for him, as per their plan. \\n After that, the elephant group never come back to the lake again. The hares lived on happily forever. \\n MORAL: From intelligence, one can overcome even the biggest problem.\", 'Once upon a time, there was an old snake. His name was Mandavishya. He used to live in a jungle. He was too old to hunt his food. So he thought of an idea to manage his need for food. He reached a pond near the mountains. There were large numbers of frogs living there. He lay down there, lying carelessly. On seeing the snake; initially, the frogs ran away out of fear. But they returned back as soon as they realized that snake had no intention to hunt them. \\n One of them gathered enough courage and asked the old snake. “Oh, sir! Why you are lying here and not hunting the frogs?” The snake replied sadly, “I am cursed. Yesterday I was hunting for food and it was my bad luck, I bit the Brahmin’s son. He became very angry and cursed me that from now on you can’t hunt your prey. He cursed me that I can’t hunt the frogs otherwise I will die. So now I am bound to serve the frogs as my masters. I will give a free ride to you as you are my masters now.” One eager frog hopped around the snake’s back and went for a long ride in and around the pond. This news spread among the frogs and their King. The King immediately reached the pond and asked the snake for a ride. The snake replied very humbly and gave a joyful ride to the King and his ministers. The next day the snake was crawling very slowly. The King frog asked the snake, “Why you are walking so slowly?” The snake replied sadly, “My master, I have not eaten anything since last 10 days!!” On hearing this, the King frog decided that every day the snake will be offered a frog so that he can give a speedy ride to the King. Gradually, the snake gained his lost strength and frog population started decreasing day by day.\\n One day, a black snake reached the pond. He was very surprised to see a snake giving joyful rides to the frogs. He inquired the old snake; “Why are you giving a jolly ride to all the frogs when they are our prey”. “Every day, I am getting a frog without hunting, which is enough for satiating my hunger,” the snake replied.\\n “As I am old now, I am getting free food without hunting every day. Therefore I’m enjoying these free meals!” he added.\\n As time passed, the snake became very strong and healthy. The King frog was completely taken in by the old snake’s clever plan. He was unable to understand the real motive behind the snake’s plan of giving free rides. And one day came when he had eaten all the frogs! \\n Then he started eating the ministers of the King Frog. At last, one day, the snake ate the King Frog. The old snake Mandavishya had finally eaten all the frogs, that too with minimal effort!\\n This story gives us a strong morale:\\n “NEVER EVER BELIEVE YOUR ENEMIES, NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY PROMISE YOU THE GAINS”', '\\n A Lame Man is a short funny story about how hastily people come into a conclusion without thinking. Just plain hasty decisions!\\n\\n \\n\\n Two men were walking on the beach. They were having a conversation about health, children, education, etc. \\n\\n \\n\\n Suddenly, they saw a man at a distance. He was limping. They started arguing about the man who was limping. The first man said that the man could have been born lame. The second one said that he could have met with any accident and become lame. \\n\\n \\n\\n They argued for some time, but none agreed with the other. They decided to ask the lame man about the cause of his limping. \\n\\n \\n\\n The first man said, ‘We have been watching you for a while. I told my friend that you were limping because you could have been born lame, but my friend argues that you were injured in an accident! Which one is true? Please tell us?’\\n\\n \\n\\n The lame man laughed at them and replied, ‘I’m not lame. It is just that one of my slippers broke and I’m finding it difficult to walk on the beach!’ \\n \\n \\n GOD is Missing \\n\\n \\n\\n Kim and Tim were twins. They were labeled as the naughtiest brothers in the world. They were very mischievous. Worried about their future, their mother and father decided to send them to a priest hoping that he could correct their ways. \\n\\n \\n\\n The priest told their parents that if they can impose the fear of god, they would change. Parents were happy. The priest asked them to send one by one so that he can have some conversation separately.\\n\\n \\n\\n The priest talked to the elder one, Kim and asked him in a loud voice ‘Where is God?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n Kim remained silent and the priest insisted again. He remained silent. The priest asked Kim to call Tim and asked him to move. \\n\\n \\n\\n Kim asked the priest, ‘Are you going to ask my brother about God?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n The priest said YES. \\n\\n \\n\\n Kim ran to Tim and shouted, ‘Tim, we are in trouble. God is missing, and everyone thinks that we are accountable for his disappearance!’', '\\n You must be already familiar with naughty Sonu by now.

Don’t miss it and visit us to read more interesting funny stories for kids. \\n\\n \\n\\n Two Targets in One Shot \\n\\n \\n\\n Sonu’s father used to go for hunting occasionally. A long drive, followed by hunting for about few minutes always attracted Sonu. The reason was Sonu’s father used to boast about his hunting prowess and good stories. Often, he would return home carrying a bird or a rabbit. \\n\\n \\n\\n One day, his father was preparing for a hunt. Sonu was very keen to go with him. He asked his father to take him along, as he was bored at home. His father took Sonu with him to the hunt. \\n\\n \\n\\n They drove a long way before they reached a lake. It was a big lake surrounded by many animals. Birds, monkeys, rabbits, and other tiny animals were sheltered by the lake. Sonu’s father was trying to hit a rabbit, but couldn’t do it. He tried many times, but could not even hit a single animal. Sonu became more bored more than he was at home. He asked his father to quit so that they could get back home. \\n\\n \\n\\n They drove back home. Sonu’s mother was surprised to see them return so soon after hunting. When they returned, there were few guests waiting for them at home. They asked them what they got in their hunting trip. As Sonu didn’t want to damage the self-image of his father, he decided to take matters into his hands. \\n\\n \\n\\n Sonu replied, ‘Mommy do you know that Dad is a great hunter! He hunted two targets at the same time!’\\n\\n \\n\\n His father remained silent. His mother became curious to know. Sonu then added, ‘Mom he shot at the head and toe of the duck simultaneously!’ \\n\\n \\n\\n Even the father was surprised to hear it as so were their guests. \\n\\n \\n\\n One guest happened to ask Sonu, ‘Where is the duck? Shooting at the head and toe together is not possible.’\\n\\n \\n\\n Sonu broke the surprise, ‘The duck was scratching the toe with its head near the lake. My dad shot at the duck’s head. Therefore, it hit the head as well as toe and the duck fell in the water! That’s two targets in one shot!’ \\n\\n \\n\\n It left everyone speechless, even Sonu’s father.', '\\n\\n Alex the lion lived in the jungle. He was big, strong and had a flowing mane. He also had the mightiest and loudest roar in the jungle, and one, which could be heard for miles around. Alex was indeed a splendid creature, but he was depressed and terribly unhappy. He suffered from a small problem that he was not able to solve. Alex had recurring bouts of hiccups.\\n It was a bad case, because it never left him. It followed him everywhere. It affected his hunting, stalking and even when he was relaxing. Alex was ready to try just about anything to cure his hiccups.\\n At first, Alex just ignored them, thinking that it would go away after a good night’s sleep. However, he was wrong. The moment he woke up the next morning and had something to drink, it would start again. Alex grew terribly depressed day by day.\\n One morning, when the hiccups resumed, he decided to clamp his mouth firmly and thought, “I shall not open my mouth and the hiccups will not be able to escape.” Although, it did stop for a few seconds, the hiccups sneaked through his gullet and resumed violently. Poor Alex, he just did not know what to do. He became even more depressed.\\n He went to see his friend Melman the Giraffe. He thought as Melman had a long neck, he surely would have an answer to his problem.\\n “Hello Alex, why are you so quiet today?” asked Melman.\\n Alex shrugged despondently, “I have got the hiccups, and I have just about tried everything. It just does not seem to go away. Perhaps, you can suggest a way to get rid of them,” said Alex.\\n “Hiccups,” said Melman, “What in the world are they?”\\n “Just watch me,” said Alex. Melman the Giraffe bent down and stared curiously at Alex. Suddenly, Alex let out three loud hiccups, “Hic, Hic, and Hic.”\\n “Oh dear me, that is really peculiar. You do seem to have a problem there,” said Melman the Giraffe.\\n “What can I do about it?” asked Alex. “Do you know of any solution to my problem?”\\n Melman the Giraffe pondered for a while and said, “I think you have this problem, because you have such a small neck. If you had a long neck like mine, I don’t think you would ever get this problem. Do you think you can make your neck a bit longer?”\\n “No,” growled Alex angrily. “Besides, I like my neck the way it is.”\\n “Too bad,” said Melman the Giraffe. “I think you would then be stuck with the hiccups.”\\n Melman got a bit curt and walked away, leaving Alex behind with his hiccups.\\n Just then, Bono the rabbit happened to dart across. \\n “Hey you,” growled Alex, “Come over here.”\\n Bono looked at Alex and trembled. \\n “Don’t be afraid of me,” thundered Alex. Just then, he got a bad attack of his hiccups. The hiccups interrupted their conversation.\\n “I need some advice,” said Alex. “Do you know a method to get rid of these hiccups?”\\n Bono the rabbit watched curiously and said, “You are a big and mighty lion. Why don’t you frighten them away?”\\n “How?” asked Alex.\\n “By roaring, of course.” Said Bono.\\n That seemed a good idea, thought Alex.\\n Between hiccups, he let out two mighty roars. Roars, so powerful, that it shook the jungle. Bono ran off, when he heard the echo. Even, Alex got a bit frightened. For a minute, the hiccups stopped, and Alex was thrilled. Then a minute later, he felt the familiar twitch and it again re-started.\\n Alex, searched for Bono, but he was nowhere to be seen. He realized that there was no point blaming Bono.\\n Bambi, the deer who was watching all this came and told Alex that it was stupid if he thought he could frighten the hiccup off with a roar.\\n “Then how do I get rid of them?” asked Alex desperately.\\n “Well, by running away them of course,” she said. “Whenever something bothers me, I just run away from it.”\\n Alex thought about this for a while and it seemed like a good idea. “Perhaps, if I run fast enough, I could get away from the hiccups,” he thought.\\n And so, Alex started running. “Faster, faster,” said Bambi, who was running beside him.\\n Alex ran with all his might with his splendid mane flying through the air, and all the animals giving way for him. Alex ran until he was exhausted. Wearily he sat down and noticed that his hiccups had gone. “I have done it at last,” said Alex.\\n He went down to the stream for a drink and drank until his stomach was full. No sooner, he finished drinking, the familiar twitch returned, and the hiccups started again.\\n Poor Alex, he burst in to tears. He was sobbing so hard between his hiccups, when Smarty the Jackal passed by and could not help wonder the reason for Alex’s sadness.\\n “What’s the problem, Alex?” asked Smarty.\\n Alex then narrated his tale of woe and Smarty the jackal started laughing so hard, that made Alex angry.\\n “You know, what your problem is Alex? You have hiccups because you don’t laugh enough,” said Smarty.\\n “How can I laugh, when there is nothing funny to laugh about?” quipped Alex.\\n “Well, there is always something funny to laugh about. For example, who has ever heard of a lion with hiccups?” said Smarty, and he started laughing.\\n Alex thought for a while and Smarty’s laughter was so infectious that he too could not help laughing.\\n He laughed so much that he was rolling in the ground with laughter.\\n Suddenly, Smarty said, “That was fun wasn’t it, and did you notice that your hiccups too have vanished?”\\n Alex got up with a start and realized that what Smarty said was correct. He waited for a minute and it did not reappear.\\n “I have got rid of the hiccups and began to laugh all over again,” he cried.\\n To this day, Alex did never have hiccups, although he laughs a little every day, just in case they might strike again.', '\\n\\n Once when traveling, we were \" snowed in,\" and as there were prospects of bad roads for weeks yet, we rented a room in a nice little rock house, in which lived a small family. Of the three children, Johnny, who was next to the baby, was a robust little fellow three years old, and he was such a chatter-box that we found great entertainment in listening to him, and al- ways found him truthful, too, which is a rare quality in \"story-telling.\" \\n Johnny used to come in to see us very early in the morning, and we were fond of having him take break- fast with us, it was such a novelty to watch his energetic way of speaking and gesticulating. \\n Sometimes his mother hastened after him, fearing that we were becoming annoyed, but it was not so. One morning, after another heavy snowfall, a tap was heard, and, opening the door, there stood Johnny, in great haste to tell us something. \"Well, Johnny, sit down with us to breakfast, and tell us while we eat.\" \\n Johnny climbed upon the pillow which sister placed on the chair for his benefit, and began, \" I killed a bear ! \" \" You didn\\'t do anything of the kind! \" said sister, but Johnny looked as dead in ear- nest as a boy could look, and answered quietly and firmly, \\'\\'I did.\" \\n \"Tell us all about it,\" said ma, who always believed in giving children a chance. \"Was it a toy bear?\" I asked. \"No, it wasn\\'t; it was a true bear, as big as a big calf, and you ought to have heard it roar ! My ! \" And Johnny stood up on the round of the chair and held up his arms. \"You\\'d better sit down ; you\\'ll lose your balance,\" said sister. Johnny sat down and proceeded to fill his cheeks with a piece of pie. His eyes roamed from one to the other, and when he had managed to swallow the greater portion, so that breathing became less difficult, he was going to resume, but his mother knocked and came in. \"O Johnny, what makes you do like this? I\\'m ashamed of you ! \" \" Never mind, he\\'s welcome, and he was just going to tell us something very wonderful,\" said ma. \"That bear I killed \"he began. \"Johnny Layton,\" interrupted his mother, \"what do you mean by talking like that ? \" \"I ain\\'t talking like that ; that bear I killed \" \"Oh, you little story-teller ! sticking to it when you know we all know better. You never saw a bear; you don\\'t know what they\\'re like.\" \"I do! I\\'ve seen their pictures, lots of \\'em.\" The laugh which followed this speech did not disconcert Johnny; he had proved that he knew what a bear looked like, and it would be easy enough to prove the rest. Ma looked kindly at Johnny, and he resumed: \"That bear I killed \" \"Johnny, don\\'t tell any more, or I\\'ll have to whip you for story -telling; it\\'s time to quit now.\" \\n \"I think we had better hear the story. I think it will come out all right,\" said ma, and Johnny began again and rushed right through. \"That bear I killed was up in Pine Valley, where I went with my pa to get a load of wood. [The auditors glanced at each other.] My pa had gone for the horses to bring home the wood, and that bear came right out behind a tree and jumped at our wagon, and when I hollered at him he stopped!\" Johnny took no discouragement from his mother\\'s mortified expression, my amazement, nor sister\\'s look, which said plainly enough, \"You little fibber !\" but went on : \"Then he come! a- jumping, and I climbed on the load, and jumped on him and killed him ! \" There was no mistaking his earnestness; he fairly glowed with excitement. \" He\\'s going to be sick with brain fever,\" said the mother tremulously. \\n \"Was it after you had the molasses candy, Johnny? \" inquired ma. \" Yes, I went off and left my candy, and I want it now,\" and Johnny began to slide down, and was soon out of the room. \"It was all a dream! I wouldn\\'t scold him; he believes it every bit.\" \"O Sister J., perhaps he did dream that ; he awoke with a scream, and, as soon as he dressed, he ran in here,\" said Johnny\\'s mother, smiling in relief. By this time he was back with his candy, and no one made any further effort to induce him to retract his statement. Johnny appeared satisfied at having finished the narrative, and at our having been unable to deprive him of the honor of the occasion. \\n When Johnny grew older, of course he was able to understand the wide difference between dreams and realities.']\n"

            " Once upon a time, there were two horses, which lived together on a shelf. However, these were not real horses, that lived and breathed, but they were real in another sort of way. The shelf they lived in was in a big shop. There, they were waiting for someone to come and purchase them.\n",
            " One of the horses was a fine wooden horse, carved out of a single block of wood. He had a muscular body with athletic legs, and a magnificent carved mane. His body was rubbed smooth with sandpaper and he was deep brownish in color. The other horse was a Bankura Horse. He had a thickset body, four short perfectly shaped legs, and a very long, long neck. He was also brown, but he was made of clay, instead of wood. \n",
            " One day the wooden horse, bored with sitting on the stand, stuck up a conversation with the Bankura horse. He told the Bankura that he was bored of sitting on that shelf all day, gathering dust and doing nothing. \n",
            " The Bankura horse replied meekly that he was quite happy sitting around and that he liked it there. The wooden horse once again snorted and complained that he did not like that place and that he hated it there. He was going to do something about it and was planning to go galloping. The Bankura was lost as to what galloping was, and asked the wooden horse as to what it meant. \n",
            " The wooden sighed at his companion’s ignorance, albeit innocence, all the while shaking his mane. He was lost as to how he came to be a horse, not knowing what galloping was. He then added that galloping came natural to horses and it was all horses did, i.e., to run at nice, fast pace. \n",
            " The Bankura was a bit apprehensive, when he heard about running, as he said it was something that he definitely could not do. “Aw, don’t be such a spoil sport. I am sure you would love it. That is what all horses do,” said the wooden horse. \n",
            " The terracotta horse insisted that he was afraid, as it was something that he could not do. He insisted that he was built to stand still and not to move around. He went on to say that, he could fall, if he tried to gallop and would break into a hundred pieces. \n",
            " The wooden pooh-poohed all this and called it as nonsense. He insisted that the Bankura was such a fine horse and that horses were meant to gallop. He commended on the Bankura’s strong body and long legs! He said that they were perfect for galloping and asked him to get ready to gallop. \n",
            " The Bankura horse was still not satisfied. \n",
            " The wooden horse continued to try and persuade the Bankura to at least to try and walk. Then the wooden horse slowly clop-clopped, up and down on the shelf. The Bankura had to admit, it was not so difficult, and saying so, he soon got down to it. Soon he too was moving, but not as fluid as the wooden horse. He found it difficult to balance and found it stiff and rather uncomfortable. \n",
            " “Bravo!” commended the wooden horse enthusiastically and was extremely pleased at the Bankura’s effort, and said that he will soon be galloping around in no time. \n",
            " But the Bankura insisted that he was not sure as to whether to continue, as he did not like it very much. \n",
            " The wooden horse was angry and was having none of this nonsense. He snapped decisively and ordered the Bankura to continue. The Bankura horse had no choice but to continue walk up and down. But, his steps continued to be jerky and uneven. \n",
            " After a while, the wooden horse felt that the Bankura had enough of practice, and that it was time to gallop. He then advised the Bankura to watch him gallop. \n",
            " He pranced up and down on the shelf. First, he quickened his steps to a canter and then he burst into a great speed as he galloped up and down on the shelf. Finally, he stopped and looked at the Bankura horse. \n",
            " The Bankura watched with awe at the wooden horse galloping. Although that was something he did want to try, he knew it was just not meant for him. The wooden horse then ordered the Bankura to try it. However, the Bankura refused as he felt that his legs were not meant for galloping and that he could likely fall down. \n",
            " Again, he pooh-poohed and ordered the Bankura to get on with it. However, the Bankura refused to move and said that he was not going to gallop. \n",
            " The wooden horse got angry when he heard this, and he galloped at full force at the Bankura and banged him with all his might. The Bankura neighed and tried to maintain his balance, but it was too late. He swiveled unsteadily and pitched over the edge of the shelf. \n",
            " “No,” he screamed and fell on the floor with a dull thud. The wooden horse watched in horrified silence and was too afraid to look down, as he was terrified at what he had just done. Slowly he gathered the courage to look down. The Bankura was lying in a basket, with his nose chipped, one of his ears broken and worst of all, one of his legs, was badly cracked. \n",
            " He apologized profusely to the Bankura and pleaded with him to speak with him. But it was of no use, as the Bankura horse lay silent, with a vacant look in his eyes. The wooden horse kept on pleading, but there was no reply. Finally, the wooden horse drew back into a corner of the shelf, full of remorse. \n",
            " The next day, the shop assistant noticed the wooden horse huddled alone in a corner, and wondered where the Bankura horse was. He looked around and spied the horse, lying in the basket. \n",
            " He cried when he saw the broken parts and planned to put him together with some glue. He finally decided to keep him because now nobody would want to purchase him. So, that evening, he took the Bankura horse and the broken pieces home, and fixed him together again. Although he did not look new, the Bankura horse was proud and happy. \n",
            " But the shopkeeper felt that something was missing. He suddenly realized that the Bankura was missing his companion. That evening, he brought home his companion, the wooden horse, who had been sitting forlornly in the shop’s shelf. \n",
            " The wooden horse apologized profusely and said, “I am sorry Bankura, can we be friends again?” \n",
            " Bankura was relieved to hear this and they lived together peacefully on the shelf, and until this day, neither of them tried to gallop again.\n",

            " Among the playmates of my childhood was an Indian girl about twelve years of age. After the Latter- day Saints had left our town, and we could not yet go with them, there were few Mormon children remaining, and our parents did not care to mingle with those who despised our people and our faith. Upon our farm, as was the custom in Southern California, several Indians were employed, and Adela was a daughter of one of the women who did washing and sewing for the white people. Adela's great grandfather and uncle also lived upon our farm, at a convenient distance from the house. Adela went to school with us when she wished, and learned all our songs, also how to crochet lace and make doll clothing. Adela could skip rope the longest, swing the highest, play ball the best, and taught us very pretty games of playing ball. One was like this : As many as chose could form a circle, standing a rod or so apart, and throw the ball to the next. As the circle was very large if the number of girls was seven or eight, and each girl had a ball to throw with one hand and catch another from the next playmate, you can see how pretty it would look, a perfect string of balls flying around the circle all the time. It required a watchful eye and skillful hands to keep the game going without a break, and it was the stillest game of ball I ever knew, while in progress ; but if a 'catcher missed, it was noisy enough till we got started again. \n",
            " Then Adela could roll hoop the prettiest, always coming out ahead at the end of the lane; climb the highest for a peep into a bird's nest, and dive into deep water where we were almost afraid to look at her. In our bow and arrow practice she could strike the mark oftener than we could, and would send her arrows one after the other like shooting stars, till her quiver was empty. \n",
            " How many a day of innocent and healthful games and pleasures we had together. 'I do not remember that we ever had a misunderstanding in all our days together. \n",
            " Adela would come early in the morning and sometimes stay till after prayer-time. If I had work or sewing to do first, she helped me. Always gentle and obliging, never rude or obtrusive, Adela was a pattern to many white girls. When her people went into the mountains, and brought back nice things, Adela al- ways brought us some, as though we were one of the family. Adela was very pretty, and her voice was as sweet as one ever heard. \n",
            " We used to coax her to sing Indian songs to us and then tell us their meaning. When Adela was older, she went with her friends on a picnic in the mountains, and while away took sick and died. I sorrowed long after my gentle mate, and can never forget her tender face, graceful form and sweet voice. As Latter-day Saints, we have a knowledge of the history of the Indian races, and look forward to their occupying a more exalted condition. How happy a time that will be, for many of them are worthy, their hearts as loving and sometimes more faithful than ours. \n",
            " Let me tell you about Minnie, an Indian babe. Her mother was a relative of Adela's, perhaps a cousin. The parents of Minnie worked on our farm for seven years. Lisifa, the mother, was of the Cabezon tribe, of California, and Pete, the father, was from the Muddy River tribe, in Nevada. \n",
            " Once, when I was away from home, my mother wrote that Lisifa had a little girl, and desired me to send it a name. I was in Salt Lake City, and replied that I would soon start home, but if the name suited them, call her Minnie. \n",
            " You see I thought that would be easy for them to speak and remember. Well, on my return I found she was a dear little thing, and soon took great interest in her. Her parents had moved into an adobe storehouse of ours, and her mother was a good house-keeper and seamstress and kept her baby more comfortably clothed than many richer babies I know of. Every morning before breakfast Minnie was ready in clean, fresh clothing for anyone to take her, and soon learned to watch for me and hold out her pretty hands. By regular bathing in water in which some fragrant herb had been steeped, Minnie's complexion was much fairer than might have been expected. Her hair shone like black satin, and her eyes were soft and black like a deer's. She used to sit on my lap while I sewed on the machine, and was very cautious not to touch anything, but would watch the movements with great interest. Minnie liked the movement of the treadle and would kick vigorously during a pause for the treadle to \" get up \" again. She often fell asleep, her head resting on her dimpled arms crossed on the machine table. \n",
            " Then I would lay her on the sofa, and cover her with shawl and mosquito-bar. If her mother happened to wonder about her baby, and looked into the room, she would smile and go back to her work. We were all fond of her. As she grew older, when father came home from the office at night, Minnie was always on the lookout, and her little shiny black head could be seen bobbing along the drive, just showing above the fleur-de-lis that bordered each side. \n",
            " Pete was the driver, and father had told him to be watchful or he might sometime drive against her; for the carriage-way was in curves instead of a straight avenue. Pete would jump down and lift her up be- side him, and they were very happy. \"Not like other poor Indian babies,\" he would say appreciatively. Pete wanted Minnie to go to school when old enough, and my parents promised him that it should be so. However, when Minnie was eighteen months old, the way opened for part of our family to come to Utah. \n",
            " Mr. Lord, a good man, promised to do as well by Pete and his family as we had, so there was a good prospect for them. They wanted to take our little hand-cart, that was used for fruit gathering, and come with us. \"I could haul Minnie and our clothes, and Lisifa and I could walk,\" he said; but it was explained to him how we would not have a fine property in Utah, and an income to pay them wages, and that they had best remain with Mr. Lord until we could send for them. Little Minnie was asleep when we came away. Father had to stay behind awhile to collect money not then due. \n",
            " One night someone rapped at his bedroom door. He asked who was there, and the answer was, \"Pete.\" \n",
            " Father arose, and, asking him in, saw that he could hardly speak, for trouble. \" What is it, Pete, tell me, poor boy.\" \n",
            " \" Minnie is dead. They had fly-paper and she put some in her mouth. Mrs. Lord could not save her. Write to the folks.\" Father tried to console him. \" Thank you, Colonel; I guess I go back to her mother.\" And he went alone, his lonely, sad, three miles' walk. We wrote to them. Father read the letter aloud and gave it to Pete. They pressed it to their cheeks, put it carefully away, and went home. That was twenty-one years ago. Just lately I heard from them. Pete had been asking an old friend if she knew anything of us. When I answered the lady's letter, I sent my picture, and she showed it to them. \" Most like her mother. Tell her about my boy I've got.'' I have written to him that a better day for his people is near at hand, and that he too may yet through knowledge perform a part.\n",

            " Far off, by an old log, he saw a fat hen. She was by her nest. In it was an egg. Ben ran up to her, and he did cry, \" Sho ! sho ! sho 1\" till she did fly off. So he got the old hen's egg, and put it in the top of his cap. As he did so a boy ran up to him. It was Bob. \" Hal-lo,\" Bob did say. \" How do you do, Ben ?\" and he hit him a tap on the top of his cap. He did not see Ben put the egg in his cap ; and, my ! the egg did go pop ! ! and it ran in his ear and his eye, and all on him from top to toe. His new cap was all egg too.\n",
            " So you see how bad it was in him not to let the old fat hen and her egg be. But he did not care a bit ; for he and Bob ran off to see the men mow the hay. It lay in the hot sun to dry.\n",
            " Bob lay on the hay, and the sun was so hot, that the end of his nose got red, and a big dog who was by the men saw the end of his nose, and ran and made a snap at it to eat it. But Ben did hop up, and he and Bob ran off.\n",
            " Ben did go in to his mamma and say : \" mam-ma ! we are so hot and so dry ! do let us get a pie to eat and a big tin mug of wa-ter ; and oh ! may we put a big bit of ice in the tin mug ?\"\n",
            " His mam-ma did say, Yes ; and so Ben and Bob did eat the pie and had a lot of fun ; for Ben bit his pie to look like a cat who had one leg, and Bob bit his pie in-to a dog who had one ear. He ate it all up; and Bob did say he had a dog-pie, and Ben had a cat-pie. Was it not fun?\n",
            " But his pa-pa did say to him : \" Why, Ben, how did you get all the egg on you?\" O how red Ben was! But he did not say a lie. no ! He did say : \"Pa-pa, I got an egg and put it in the top of my new cap, but Bob did not see it, and he did tap the top of my cap, and the egg did go pop ! all on me, and the top of my new cap is all egg. How can I get it off?\"\n",
            " His pa-pa was full of joy, as his son did not say a lie, and he did try to get all the egg off of the new cap. And now Ben and Bob ran off, and Ben had a lot of fun, for he was not bad ; no ! he was a boy who did not say a lie, and so he had joy and fun all day. If you are not bad, you can have joy and fun too.

            "Once there lived a big herd of elephants near a river. They would play, eat and rest near the river. The surrounding area had lush green grass and fruit trees, which served food for the elephants. \n",

            " All the elephants reached out to their master and cried. “Oh! Our Lord! There is no water left in the river. Our infants are facing death and hunger.

The hares who ran away managed to save themselves from their wrath. The elephants didn’t care about anyone. The hares found themselves helpless against the mighty elephants. \n",
            " After the elephants went back into the jungle, the hares had a meeting. They were aware that the elephants are very powerful and they cannot beat them physically. So, they decided that it's better to run away in order to save themselves from their wrath. \n",

            " After explaining his plan, all the hares agreed to help. As per his plan, one hare went to the hilltop.

This lake belongs to the Moon-God.” \n",
            " “Your selfish act invited the ire of the Moon-God. I am the messenger of Moon-God, he has sent me to convey to you his message. If you want to survive, then don’t even think about coming near the lake again,” he further said. \n",
            " The king elephant replied, “I am sorry, for my sinful act. Oh, Moon-God! Please forgive me!!” The clever hare sitting on the hill replied, “If you want to be forgiven, come to the lake and ask me for forgiveness. You must also offer condolences to the king of hares.” The elephant king walked up to the lake, where saw the reflection of Moon. \n",
            " He immediately asked the MOON for forgiveness. He also said sorry to the king of hares, who was waiting for him, as per their plan. \n",

            "Once upon a time, there was an old snake. His name was Mandavishya. He used to live in a jungle. He was too old to hunt his food. So he thought of an idea to manage his need for food. He reached a pond near the mountains. There were large numbers of frogs living there. He lay down there, lying carelessly. On seeing the snake; initially, the frogs ran away out of fear. But they returned back as soon as they realized that snake had no intention to hunt them. \n",
            " One of them gathered enough courage and asked the old snake. “Oh, sir! Why you are lying here and not hunting the frogs?” The snake replied sadly, “I am cursed. Yesterday I was hunting for food and it was my bad luck, I bit the Brahmin’s son. He became very angry and cursed me that from now on you can’t hunt your prey. He cursed me that I can’t hunt the frogs otherwise I will die. So now I am bound to serve the frogs as my masters. I will give a free ride to you as you are my masters now.” One eager frog hopped around the snake’s back and went for a long ride in and around the pond. This news spread among the frogs and their King. The King immediately reached the pond and asked the snake for a ride. The snake replied very humbly and gave a joyful ride to the King and his ministers. The next day the snake was crawling very slowly. The King frog asked the snake, “Why you are walking so slowly?” The snake replied sadly, “My master, I have not eaten anything since last 10 days!!” On hearing this, the King frog decided that every day the snake will be offered a frog so that he can give a speedy ride to the King. Gradually, the snake gained his lost strength and frog population started decreasing day by day.\n",
            " One day, a black snake reached the pond. He was very surprised to see a snake giving joyful rides to the frogs. He inquired the old snake; “Why are you giving a jolly ride to all the frogs when they are our prey”. “Every day, I am getting a frog without hunting, which is enough for satiating my hunger,” the snake replied.\n",
            " “As I am old now, I am getting free food without hunting every day. Therefore I’m enjoying these free meals!” he added.\n",
            " As time passed, the snake became very strong and healthy. The King frog was completely taken in by the old snake’s clever plan. He was unable to understand the real motive behind the snake’s plan of giving free rides. And one day came when he had eaten all the frogs! \n",
            " Then he started eating the ministers of the King Frog. At last, one day, the snake ate the King Frog. The old snake Mandavishya had finally eaten all the frogs, that too with minimal effort!\n",

For a minute, the hiccups stopped, and Alex was thrilled. Then a minute later, he felt the familiar twitch and it again re-started.\n",

            " Bambi, the deer who was watching all this came and told Alex that it was stupid if he thought he could frighten the hiccup off with a roar.\n",

            " And so, Alex started running. “Faster, faster,” said Bambi, who was running beside him.\n",
            " Alex ran with all his might with his splendid mane flying through the air, and all the animals giving way for him. Alex ran until he was exhausted. Wearily he sat down and noticed that his hiccups had gone. “I have done it at last,” said Alex.\n",
            " He went down to the stream for a drink and drank until his stomach was full. No sooner, he finished drinking, the familiar twitch returned, and the hiccups started again.\n",
            " Poor Alex, he burst in to tears. He was sobbing so hard between his hiccups, when Smarty the Jackal passed by and could not help wonder the reason for Alex’s sadness.\n",
            " “What’s the problem, Alex?” asked Smarty.\n",
            " Alex then narrated his tale of woe and Smarty the jackal started laughing so hard, that made Alex angry.\n",
            " “You know, what your problem is Alex? You have hiccups because you don’t laugh enough,” said Smarty.\n",
            " “How can I laugh, when there is nothing funny to laugh about?” quipped Alex.\n",
            " “Well, there is always something funny to laugh about. For example, who has ever heard of a lion with hiccups?” said Smarty, and he started laughing.\n",
            " Alex thought for a while and Smarty’s laughter was so infectious that he too could not help laughing.\n",
            " He laughed so much that he was rolling in the ground with laughter.\n",
            " Suddenly, Smarty said, “That was fun wasn’t it, and did you notice that your hiccups too have vanished?”\n",
            " Alex got up with a start and realized that what Smarty said was correct. He waited for a minute and it did not reappear.\n",
            " “I have got rid of the hiccups and began to laugh all over again,” he cried.\n",
            " To this day, Alex did never have hiccups, although he laughs a little every day, just in case they might strike again.\n",

            " Once when traveling, we were \" snowed in,\" and as there were prospects of bad roads for weeks yet, we rented a room in a nice little rock house, in which lived a small family. Of the three children, Johnny, who was next to the baby, was a robust little fellow three years old, and he was such a chatter-box that we found great entertainment in listening to him, and al- ways found him truthful, too, which is a rare quality in \"story-telling.\" \n",
            " Johnny used to come in to see us very early in the morning, and we were fond of having him take break- fast with us, it was such a novelty to watch his energetic way of speaking and gesticulating. \n",
            " Sometimes his mother hastened after him, fearing that we were becoming annoyed, but it was not so. One morning, after another heavy snowfall, a tap was heard, and, opening the door, there stood Johnny, in great haste to tell us something. \"Well, Johnny, sit down with us to breakfast, and tell us while we eat.\" \n",
            " Johnny climbed upon the pillow which sister placed on the chair for his benefit, and began, \" I killed a bear ! \" \" You didn't do anything of the kind! \" said sister, but Johnny looked as dead in ear- nest as a boy could look, and answered quietly and firmly, ''I did.\" \n",
            " \"Tell us all about it,\" said ma, who always believed in giving children a chance. \"Was it a toy bear?\" I asked. \"No, it wasn't; it was a true bear, as big as a big calf, and you ought to have heard it roar ! My ! \" And Johnny stood up on the round of the chair and held up his arms. \"You'd better sit down ; you'll lose your balance,\" said sister. Johnny sat down and proceeded to fill his cheeks with a piece of pie. His eyes roamed from one to the other, and when he had managed to swallow the greater portion, so that breathing became less difficult, he was going to resume, but his mother knocked and came in. \"O Johnny, what makes you do like this? I'm ashamed of you ! \" \" Never mind, he's welcome, and he was just going to tell us something very wonderful,\" said ma. \"That bear I killed \"he began. \"Johnny Layton,\" interrupted his mother, \"what do you mean by talking like that ? \" \"I ain't talking like that ; that bear I killed \" \"Oh, you little story-teller ! sticking to it when you know we all know better. You never saw a bear; you don't know what they're like.\" \"I do! I've seen their pictures, lots of 'em.\" The laugh which followed this speech did not disconcert Johnny; he had proved that he knew what a bear looked like, and it would be easy enough to prove the rest. Ma looked kindly at Johnny, and he resumed: \"That bear I killed \" \"Johnny, don't tell any more, or I'll have to whip you for story -telling; it's time to quit now.\" \n",
            " \"I think we had better hear the story. I think it will come out all right,\" said ma, and Johnny began again and rushed right through. \"That bear I killed was up in Pine Valley, where I went with my pa to get a load of wood. [The auditors glanced at each other.] My pa had gone for the horses to bring home the wood, and that bear came right out behind a tree and jumped at our wagon, and when I hollered at him he stopped!\" Johnny took no discouragement from his mother's mortified expression, my amazement, nor sister's look, which said plainly enough, \"You little fibber !\" but went on : \"Then he come! a- jumping, and I climbed on the load, and jumped on him and killed him ! \" There was no mistaking his earnestness; he fairly glowed with excitement. \" He's going to be sick with brain fever,\" said the mother tremulously. \n",
            " \"Was it after you had the molasses candy, Johnny? \" inquired ma. \" Yes, I went off and left my candy, and I want it now,\" and Johnny began to slide down, and was soon out of the room. \"It was all a dream! I wouldn't scold him; he believes it every bit.\" \"O Sister J., perhaps he did dream that ; he awoke with a scream, and, as soon as he dressed, he ran in here,\" said Johnny's mother, smiling in relief. By this time he was back with his candy, and no one made any further effort to induce him to retract his statement. Johnny appeared satisfied at having finished the narrative, and at our having been unable to deprive him of the honor of the occasion. \n",
            " When Johnny grew older, of course he was able to understand the wide difference between dreams and realities.\n"
